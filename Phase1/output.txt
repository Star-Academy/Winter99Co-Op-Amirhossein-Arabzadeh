I have a 42 yr old male friend, misdiagnosed as havin osteopporosis for two years, who recently found out that hi illness is the rare Gaucher's disease.Gaucher's disease symptoms include: brittle bones (he lost 9 inches off his hieght); enlarged liver and spleen; interna bleeding; and fatigue (all the time). The problem (in Type 1) i attributed to a genetic mutation where there is a lack of th enzyme glucocerebroside in macrophages so the cells swell up This will eventually cause deathEnyzme replacement therapy has been successfully developed an approved by the FDA in the last few years so that those patient administered with this drug (called Ceredase) report a remarkabl improvement in their condition. Ceredase, which is manufacture by biotech biggy company--Genzyme--costs the patient $380,00 per year. Gaucher\'s disease has justifyably been called "the mos expensive disease in the world"NEED INFOI have researched Gaucher's disease at the library but am relyin on netlanders to provide me with any additional information**news, stories, report**people you know with this diseas**ideas, articles about Genzyme Corp, how to get a hold o   enough money to buy some, programs available to help wit   costs**Basically ANY HELP YOU CAN OFFEThanks so very muchDeborah

As I understand, these are all short termI second what Spenser Aden said in reply.  Additionally, it is hard to sawhat type of response you ar3e having to prednisone since you did not sahow long you have been on it.  Patients are generally kept on steroids fomonths before thinking about tapering.  Alternatives to daily dosing areevery other day dosing, in your case 20mg every other day would be a startAnother option if it is not possible to get you off prednisone is to starazathioprine.  Like Spenser said, you should generally be on another druin addition to your prednisone, like asulfidine.  A lot of the specificabout options, though, depends on severity, location, and duration ofdisease, as well as histology, so take advice off the net for what iis worth. I treat patients with UC and Crohn's.  An educated patient is a goodpatient, but let your doctor know where the advice came from so thingcan be put in context.  You should also be a member of the Crohn's anColitis Foundation of America.  1-800-932-2423 office / 1-800-343-363info hotlineBest of Luck to youSteve Hollandgila005@uabdpo.dpo.uab.ed

A friend of mine is going in later this week for tests to see if haemphysema.  His lung capacity has decreased over time.  His father dieof the disease.  He works in woodworking.  I believe he has a veroccasional cigarette, perhaps one cigarette a day or even less.  He tellme this..I've never seen him light up.  He has some pretty healthlife style habits, good diet, exercise, meditation, retreats, therapetc.  Anyhow..he is very concerned with this check up.  I know reallnothing about the disease.  I believe it interferes with the lininof the lung being able to exchange oxygen. Is a diagnosis of emphysema a death sentence?  If he were to give up smokinentirely would that better his chances for recovery?  What are somemodern therapies used in people with this disease?  I would appreciateany information.

"Situs inversus" means that organs are on the wronside of the body, and can be complete or partial. It is interestinmedically because the normal location of organs is caused in parby the "normal" rotation associated with ciliary motion, so that iabsence of this, laterality can be "random." People with situinversus are quite popular at medical schools, because of theirarity, and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when thecan't find the patient's heart sounds (because they're on the wronside).According to Harrison's, immotile cilia syndrom is an autosomarecessive, which should imply that on average one child in fouin a family would be affected.

"Real" internistcan talk for hours about clubbing. I'm limited to a couplof minutesWhether this distinction has anything to do with reality ientirely unclear, but it is one of those things that internistlove to paw over during rounds. Supposedly, only "true" clubbinis associated with disease. The problem is that the list odiseases associated with clubbing is quite long, and includeboth congenital conditions and acquired disease. Since many othese diseases are associated with cardiopulmonary problemleading to right to left shunts and chronic hypoxemia, it ivery reasonable to get a chest xray. However, many of thecongenital abnormalities would only be diagnosed with a cardiacatheterization.The cause of clubbing is unclear, but presumably relates tsome factor causing blood vessels in the distal fingertip tdilate abnormally.Clubbing is one of those things from an examination which ia tipoff to do more extensive examination. Often, howeverthe cause of the clubbing is quite apparent-k

I noticed several years ago that when I took analgesics fairly regularly(motrin at the time), I seemed to get a lot of migraines.  But haforgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts hereI generally don't take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches, because I'vfound them to be ineffective.  However, I have two other pain sourcethat force me to take NSAIDS (currently Naprosyn).  First, is sompelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period, and then mucworse at midcycle.  I have had surgery for endometriosis in the pas(~12 years ago), so the Drs. tell me that my pain is probably duto the endometriosis coming back.  I've tried Synarel, it reducethe pain while I took it (3 mos), but the pain returned immediatelafter I stopped.  Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as thonly "real solution" to my problem.  Although I don\'t expect to havany more children, I don't like the idea of having my uterus anone remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when I hathe surgery for endometriosis).  One of the Drs that suggesteI get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery, but perhaps thinkthat type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plato have children.  So basically all I'm left with is toughing outhe pain.  This would be impossible without Naprosyn (or somethinsimilar - but not aspirin, that doesn't work, and Motrin gave mhorrible gastritis a few years ago, so I'm through with it).  Ifact, Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I takit regularly as I did when I had severe back pain (and pain in bothlegs) as I'll discuss in a moment.  Generally though, I wait untiI have the pain before I take the Naprosyn, but then it takeseveral hours for it reduce the pain (it's actually quite effectivat reducing the pain, it just takes quite a while).  In the meantimI'm frequently in severe painThe other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting ibilateral radiculopathy.  I've had MRIs, Xrays, CT scan, and EMG(I've had 2 of them, and don't intend to ever do that again) witnerve conduction tests.  The tests have not been conclusive as twhat is causing my back and leg pain.  The MRI reports both say I havseveral bulging, degeneratig disks, and from the Xrays (and MRI, I thinkit is apparent that I have arthritis.  The reading on the CT scawas that there are two herniations (L3-L4, and L4-L5), but otherhav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniationsThe second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervatiocompared to the first EMG.  Oh yeah, I had some other horrible testcalled something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that th"internal nerves" are working fine.   Anyway, the bottom line is thaI sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain.  The back paiis there all the time, but I can live with it.  When the leg pain is thereI need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the paito a level where I can work.  So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-months (every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse, so I'dalways resume).  Since last November I have taken it much less frequentlyand primarily for the pelvic pain.  I have been going to physicatherapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week).  After the first montor so, my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlierbut it had caused a lot of pain in my back, this time she tried it aa lower weight).  After a month or two, the pain in my legs began goinaway (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back, whiccould be reduced with ultrasound and massage).  So now, I don't havnearly as much pain in my legs, in fact my therapist took me oftraction about 2 weeks agoGetting back to my original reason for this post...  Even if I can avoitaking analgesic for headaches, I really can't avoid them entirely becausI have other pain sources, that "force" me to use them (Oh, I forgoto mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgerybut I'm avoiding that too).  I find the migraines difficult to deal withoccassionally I have to take off work, but usually I can work, but aa reduced capacity (I'm a systems engineer and do a lot of readinand writing).  When the pelvic pain is bad, I can't concentrate muchI usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes, becausthe pain is so bothersome.  When the pain in my back is bad, it cacause severe burning in both legs, shooting pains in my legs, electrishock type of pain in my feet and toes, and basically when it gets baI can't really sit at all.  Then I end up spending most of my time homand in bed.  So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines, thmigraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources.  I get a loof migraines, an average of 3 to 4 a month, which last 1-3 daysI've taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me sI reduced the dosage), but I don't like the side effects (if I takmore than two I get diahrea).  If I get a very bad headache, I wileventually take the cafergot.  My neurologist wasn't very helpful wheI told him my problems with cafergot, he said that when sumatriptabecomes available, I should try that.  I've tried several other medication(fiornal, midrin, fiornal with codeine, tegretol, and inderal) buthey either didn't work, or I couldn't tolerate them.  So what can I doMy doctor's seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate thpain, which I agree with most of the time, but not when I have a lot opain.  I've had some bad experiences with surgery (my heart stoppeonce from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely thsuccinylcholine), and I've already had surgery several timesAnyway, the point of what I'm saying is that even if analgesics can contributto migraines, some people NEED to take them to tolerate other painJanice Rathman

I may not be the world's greatest expert on chiggers (a type omite indigenous to the south), but I certainly have spent a loof time contemplating the little buggers over the past six year(since we moved to N.C.).  Here are some observations gained fropainful experience  1. Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person     Some people get tiny red bites.  Others (like me) are mor     sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs  2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving.  I swea     that these things will itch for months  3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers.  I think most o     it is fiction.  I have tried to do research on the critters     since they have such an effect on me.  The only book I coul     find on the subject was a *single* book in UNC's specia     collections library.  I have not yet gone through what i     required to get it  4. Based on my experience and that of my family members, the ol     folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn't work.  I recal     reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chigger     burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false.       think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of som     sort the little pests release.  But this is speculation  5. The *best* approach is prevention.  A couple of things work well     A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberall     applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start.  There i     another preparation called "Chig Away" that is a combination o     sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally wa     prepared for the Army and is not commercially available.  I     the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I ge     up on weekends since I literally can't go outside where w     live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (The     apparently don't like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfu     as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.  6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forge     the fingernail polish.  I have finally settled upon a treatmen     that involves topical application of a combination of cortison     creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocain     (relieves the itch).  I won't tell you all the things I've tried     Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since thi     counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also thin     it gains nothing)  7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieve     by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recover     as wellDoctors seem not to care much about chiggers.  The urban and suburbadoctors apparently don't encounter them much.  And the rural doctorseem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure.  suspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggerwould make a *lot* of money--Gary H.

     The biggest reason why the cost of medical care is so EXTREMELY high anincreasing is that NATURAL methods of treatment and even diagnosis are stilbeing SYSTEMATICALLY IGNORED and SUPPRESSED by the MONEY-GRUBBING and POWERMONGERING "medical" establishment     Some examples of very low cost NATURAL ANTI-cancer Remedies are listed ithe following article                          NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIE                                 A 3RD OPINIO                        ( Some of these Remedies also work against AIDS.           DISCLAIMER: This list was compiled from unorthodox sources          that have shown themselves to be reliable.  The compiler of          this list is NOT a doctor of any kind, but is exercising his          First Amendment Constitutional RIGHT of FREE SPEECH on the          subjects of his choice.          ( MOST of these Remedies can be found in ANY Grocery Store.           MOST of the rest of them can be found in ANY Health Food          Store.  What is important is HOW they are used, and what          else is EXCLUDED DURING their use.           (1) THE 7-DAY FAST.               1st day: Eat as much fresh fruit as you want, one kind          at a time, preferably grapes.               2nd day: Eat all the vegetables you want, at least half          raw, including GARLIC; also, whole kernel corn to help scrape          clean the intestinal linings.               3rd day: Drink all the fresh fruit and vegetable juice          you want.  Preferably start with 16 to 32 ounces of prune          juice WITH PULP, followed by a gallon of pure (NOT from          concentrate) apple juice, then grape juice.  (Stay close to          your home bathroom.)               4th day: Eat all the UN-salted nuts (NO peanuts) and          dried fruit you want, preferably raisins and almonds (ALMONDS          CONTAIN LAETRILE.).               5th day: ONE GALLON OF LEMONADE.  Squeeze the juice from          two lemons into a gallon of water (preferably distilled), and          add 2 to 4 tablespoons of locally-made honey, (NO sugar).           Drink one glass per hour          [EVERYone, including healthy people, should do this one day          every week, preceded by a large glass of prune juice WITH          PULP.]               6th day: Same as 5th day.               7th day: Same as 6th day.               All 7 days, eat ONLY the foods listed above for each          day, along with your usual vitamin and mineral supplements,          plus as much DISTILLED WATER as you want.          (2) THE GRAPE DIET.               Eat 2 to 3 ounces of fresh grapes every 2 hours, 8 AM to          8 PM, every day for six days.  Eat NOTHING else during the          six days, but drink as much DISTILLED WATER as you want.               (3) APPLE CIDER VINEGAR               Mix a teaspoon of pure apple cider vinegar (NOT apple          cider "flavored" vinegar.  Regular vinegar is HARMFUL.) in a          glass of water (preferably distilled) and drink all of it.           Do this 3 or 4 times per day, for 3 weeks; then stop for a          week.  Repeat if desired.  Do this along with a normal          healthy diet of natural foods.  This remedy is especially          effective against those types of cancer that resemble a          FUNGUS, as well as against other kinds of fungus infections.                 (4) THE SEA-SALT & SODA BATH.  [Please keep an OPEN MIND.               Fill a bathtub with moderately warm water so the level          comes up almost to the overflow drain when you get in.           Immerse yourself in it for a minute, and then completely          dissolve in the bath water 1 pound of SUN-evaporated SEA-salt          (regular salt won't work.) and 1 pound of fresh baking-soda.               Soak in this bath for 10 to 20 minutes, while exercising          your fingers, toes, and limbs, turning sideways and onto your          stomach, dunking your head, sitting up and laying back down,          chomping your teeth together, etc..               Among other things, the SEA-salt & Soda Bath neutralizes          the accumulated effects of X-rays, etc., as described in the          book "Born To Be Magnetic, Vol. 2", by Frances Nixon, 1973.               PRECAUTIONS: Only the ONE person using each bath should          prepare it and drain it          For at least 30 minutes after taking the bath, stay away          from, and even out of sight of, other people.  (Your greatly          expanded Aura energy-field during that time could disrupt          other people's fields.)  Two hours after the bath, eat at          least 8 ounces of yogurt containing ACTIVE Yogurt Cultures.           (The bath may kill FRIENDLY bacteria also.)  Better yet, take          a 2-Billion-bacteria "Acidophilus" capsule, which is also an          EXCELLENT DAILY REMEDY AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF "A.I.D.S."          (because it kills all kinds of harmful bacteria in the          digestive tract, taking a big load off the remaining immune          system).  [Because this external bath can kill IN-ternal          bacteria, it may also be a CURE for "Lyme disease".          Do NOT take this bath within a few hundred miles of a thunder          storm, within 3 days of a full moon, nor during "Major" or          "Minor Periods" as listed in the "Solunar Tables" published          bimonthly in "Field & Stream" Magazine, (because of the          measurable disruptive ambient environmental energy-fields          present at those times)          Do NOT take this bath more than four times per year.                (5) MISCELLANEOUS NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES:                     For skin cancer, apply STABILIZED Aloe Vera Jel to the               affected skin twice daily, and take 2 to 4 tablespoons               per day of STABILIZED Aloe Vera Juice internally, for               about 2 months.                      D.M.S.O. (Dimethyl Sulfoxide) causes cancer cells to               perform NORMAL cell functions.               ALMONDS (UN-blanched, UN-roasted) CONTAIN LAETRILE.                To help prevent cancer, eat several almonds every day.                To help cure cancer, eat several OUNCES of almonds per               day               [NEVER take large concentrated doses of Laetrile orally.                IT WILL KILL YOU!  Take it INTRAVENOUSLY ONLY.  (Cancer               cells contain a certain enzyme which converts Laetrile               into cyanide, which then kills the cell.  This enzyme is               ALSO present in the digestive system.)]               ANTI-OXIDANTS are FREE-RADICAL SCAVENGERS, and include               Vitamin E, Selenium (200 mcg. per day is safe for most               people.), Chromium (up to 100 mcg. per day), Vitamin A               (25,000 IU per day is safe for most people.), Superoxide               Dismutase (up to 4,000,000 Units per day), Vitamin C (up               to 3000 mg. per day), and BHT (Butylated Hydroxy               toluene), [1 to 4 capsules of BHT every night at bedtime               will also MAKE ONE IMMUNE AGAINST HERPES (BOTH types),               suppress herpes symptoms if one already has herpes,               prevent spreading herpes to other people, but will not               cure herpes.  BHT MIGHT ALSO DO THESE THINGS AGAINST               "A.I.D.S.", which is really a form of cancer similar to               leukemia.]  (See the book "Life Extension", by Durk               Pearson and Sandy Shaw.)               HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE.  Dilute twelve(12) drops of 3%               hydrogen-peroxide in a glass of pure water (preferably               DISTILLED) and drink it.  Do this once or twice per day,               hours before or after eating or drinking anything else.                Apply 3% hydrogen-peroxide directly to skin cancers               several times per day               Use hydrogen-peroxide ONLY if you are taking a good               daily dose of some of the various anti-oxidants               described above.               VITAMIN & MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS are more effective, and               much less expensive, when COMBINED together in MEGA               doses into SINGLE tablets made from NATURAL sources.               Cancer cells can NOT live in a strong (100,000 Maxwell)               NORTH MAGNETIC FIELD, especially if it is pulsating on               and off.  [A strong south magnetic field is an               aphrodisiac.]  In my opinion, ALL types of ionizing               radiation treatments for cancer should be REPLACED with               daily 30-minute doses of pulsating 100,000-Maxwell NORTH               magnetic fields.               Properly made and operated RADIONICS/PSIONICS MACHINES               can both diagnose and cure all forms of cancer, as well               as most other medical problems.  Some Radionics/Psionics               Machines can even take cross-sectional X-ray-like photos               of cancer tumors, etc., with-OUT X-rays!               INTERFERON tablets               TAHEEBO TEA, (Lapacho).                         HOMEOPATHY can cure cancer, and many other medical               problems (even drug addiction!).               50 mg. per day of CHELATED ZINC can help prevent or cure               prostate trouble.               This list is NOT exhaustive.          The above NATURAL Remedies can CURE both diagnosed AND UN          DIAGNOSED cancers, as well as PREVENT them, and also prevent          and cure many other medical problems including heart          diseases.  They are NOT too simple and inexpensive to work          effectively.          Besides acting on a person biologically and chemically, these          remedies, especially The 7-Day Fast and The Grape Diet, send          a strong message to one's subconscious mind, PROGRAMMING it          to CURE the cancer.          In my opinion, if a person finds out that s/he has cancer,          then s/he should promptly try at least the first 4 remedies          described above, in sequence (starting with The 7-Day Fast),          BEFORE resorting to the UN-natural and expensive mutilations          and agonies [POISON, BURN, and MUTILATE!] of orthodox cancer          treatment [organi$ed-CRIME!].                            DISCLAIMER: This list was compiled from unorthodox sources          that have shown themselves to be reliable.  The compiler of          this list is NOT a doctor of any kind, but is exercising his          First Amendment Constitutional RIGHT of FREE SPEECH on the          subjects of his choice.

I still believthat doing your own research is very, very necessary.  I woulnot have progressed as much as I have today, unless I had spenthe many hours in Stanford's Med Library as I have doneAnd 5 years ago, it was clear that there was no medicine thatwould help me.  So should I have stopped searching.  Thangoodness I didn't.  Now I found that there is indeed medicinthat helps me. I think that what you've said is kind of idealistic.  That yowould go to one doctor, get a diagnosis, maybe get a seconopinion, and then move on with your lifeJust as an example... having seen 6 of the top specialists inthis field in the country, I have received 6 different diagnosesThese are the top names, the ones that people come to from all ovethe country.  I have HAD to sort all of this out myself.  Gointo a support group (and in fact, HEADING that support group) washelpful for a while, but after a point, I found it verunproductive.  It was much more productive to do library researchmake phone calls and put together the pieces of the puzzle myselfA recent movie, Lorenzo's Oil, offers a perfect example of whaI'm talking about.  If you haven't seen it, you should.  It's noa put down of doctor's and neither is what I'm saying.  Doctors aronly human and can only do so much.  But there are those of uout here who are intelligent and able to sometimes find a missinpiece of the puzzle that might have otherwise gone unnoticedI guess I'm biased because dizziness is one of those weird thingthat is still so unknown.  If I had a broken arm, or a weak heartor failing kidneys, I might not have the same opinion.  That's becausethose things are much more tangible and have much more concisedefinitions and treatments.

Spoofing a keyboard over the serial por\tIf you've got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboar\t(Sun, HP, DEC, etc.) then you're going to have a hard time findin\ta vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard.  If your workstatio\truns the X window system, you're in luck.  You can buy a cheap use\tPC, hook your expensive keyboard up to it, and run a serial cabl\tto your workstation.  Then, run a program on the workstation to rea\tthe serial port and generate fake X keyboard events\tThe two main programs I've found to do this are KT and A2X\ta2x is a sophisticated program, capable of controlling the mouse, an\teven moving among widgets on the screen.  It requires a serve\textension (XTEST, DEC-XTRAP, or XTestExtension1).  To find out if you\tserver can do this, run 'xdpyinfo' and see if any of these string\tappear in the extensions list.  If your server doesn't have this\tyou may want to investigate compiling X11R5, patchlevel 18 or later\tor bugging your vendor\tkt is a simpler program, which should work with unextended X servers\tAnother program called xsendevent also exists, but I haven't seen it\tBoth a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu    2.

NeX\tNeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple Deskto\tBus, meaning any Mac keyboard will work.  Then, they announced the\twere cancelling their hardware production.  If you want any kind o\tupgrade for an older NeXT, do it now    4. Silicon Graphic\tSilicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines (Indigo^2 an\tbeyond) will use standard PC-compatible keyboards and mice.  I don'\tbelieve this also applies to the Power Series machines.  It's no\tpossible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards, except b\tupgrading the entire machine.  Contact your SGI sales rep for mor\tdetails    5. IBM RS/600\tIBM RS/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards.  |\tUnfortunately, you can't just plug one in.  You need two things: a  |\tcable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the   |\tsmaller PS/2 style DIN-6, and a new device driver for AIX.  Believe |\tit or not, IBM wrote this device driver recently, I used it, and it |\tworks.  However, they don't want me to redistribute it.

It does not provide exercises, but it does chec\tthat you really do take a break, and tells you when yo\tcan start typing again. \tTypewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typin\ttoday, each time it warns you, which is useful so yo\tknow how much you *really* type.  It also logs informatio\tto a file that you can analyse or simply print out. \tThe warning message appears on your screen (in character mode)\tin a pop-up window (for X Windows), or as a Zephyr messag\t(for those with Athena stuff).   Tim Freeman <tsf@cs.cmu.edu>\thas put in a lot of bug fixes, extra features and support for\tX, Zephyr and Mach\tNot formally supported, but email richardd@hoskyns.co.u\t(for SCO, SunOS, character mode) or tsf@cs.cmu.edu (for Mach\tX Window mode, Zephyr) if you have problems or want to give\tfeedback    Tool: Various calendar / batch queue program    Available from\tVarious source    Platforms: Variou    Description\tAny calendar/reminder program that warns you of an upcomin\tappointment can be turned into an ad hoc RSI management tool\tOr, any batch queue submission program that lets you submi\ta program to run at a specific time to display a message t\tthe screen\tUsing Windows as an example: create a Calendar file, an\tinclude this filename in your WIN.INI's 'load=' line s\tyou get it on every startup of Windows.  Suppose yo\twant to have breaks every 30 minutes, starting from 9 am\tPress F7 (Special Time...) to enter an appointment, ente\t9:30, hit Enter, and type some text in saying what the brea\tis for.  Then press F5 to set an alarm on this entry, and repeat\tfor the next appointment\tBy using Windows Recorder, you can record the keystroke\tthat set up breaks throughout a day in a .REC file.  Put thi\tfile on your 'run=' line, as above, and you will then, wit\ta single keypress, be able to set up your daily appointment\twith RSI exercises\tThe above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs.\tAn example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple jo\tthat runs at 9:30 am and warns you to take a break; this wil\tdepend a lot on your operating system\tWhile these approaches are not ideal, they are a good way of forcing\tyourself to take a break if you can't get hold of a suitable RSI\tmanagement tool.  If you are techie enough you might want t\twrite a version of Typewatch (see above) for your operatin\tsystem, using batch jobs or whatever fits best    Tool: Digital watches with count-down timer    Available from\tVarious sources, e.g. Casio BP-100    Description\tMany digital watches have timers that count down from a settabl\tnumber of minutes; they usually reset easily to that number, eithe\tmanually or automatically. \tWhile these are a very basic tool, they are very useful if yo\tare writing, reading, driving, or doing anything away fro\ta computer which can still cause or aggravate RSI.  The grea\tadvantage is that they remind you to break from whatever yo\tare doing\    Comments\tMy own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led t\tmy writing a lot more, and still reading as much as ever, whic\tactually aggravated the RSI in my right arm though the lef\tarm improved.  Getting a count-down timer watch has bee\tvery useful on some occasions where I write a lot in a day\tI have tried an old fashioned hour-glass type egg timer, bu\tthese are not much good because they do not give an audibl\twarning of the end of the time periodKEYBOARD REMAPPING TOOLS: these enable you to change your keyboard mappinso you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed layout. One-handed typing tools may help, but be VERY careful about howyou use them -- if you keep the same overall typing workload yoare simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typingand may therefore make matters worse    Tool: hsh (public domain    Available from\tAnonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/hsh.sha    Platforms: UNIX (don't know which ones    Description\tAllows one-handed typing and other general keyboard remappings\tOnly works through tty's (so, you can use it with a terminal o\tan xterm, but not most X programs)    Tool: Dvorak keyboard tools (various    Available from\tAnonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/xdvorak.\tAlso built into Windows 3.x.

As usual, you are missing the whole point, Russell, because you are nowilling to even consider questionning your basic article of faith, whicis that science is merely a matter of methodology and that the highespurpose of science is to avoid making mistakes. This is like saying that the most important aspect of business managemenis accurate bookkeeping. If science were no more than methodology and not making mistakes, iwould be a poor thing indeed.  What was the methodology of Darwin?  Whawas the methodology of Einstein?  What was, for that matter, thmethodology of Jenner and Pasteur?

I, in particular, think the basic ideas ohomeopathy and chiropracty seem extremely flaky. What some of us do believe, however, is that some of these thing(including some of the flaky ideas) are deserving of serious scientifiattention. If in fact it were true, as you have stated above, that those who do nouse the currently fashionable methodology can have no idea what ieffective and what is not, then science today would not exist.  For alof current science is based on the past work of scientists whosmethodology, by current standards, was seriously flawed. It is certainly true that as methodology improves, we need to re-examinthose results derived in the past using less perfect methodologies.  It ialso true that the results obtained by people today who still rely onthose early methodologies needs to be re-examined in a more rigorousfashion by those qualified to do so credibly. But to say that nobody who fails to do elaborate double-blind studies icapable of knowing their ass from a hole in the ground and to say that nideas that come from outside the scientific establishment could possiblbe worthy of serious investigation ... this truly marks one's attitude adoctrinaire, cultist.  This attitude is not compatible with a belief ireason. -In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seemsless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.  lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitne

As soon as you possibly can.  Thdifference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recoverand a long, drawn-out ordeal.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.  Now, your garden-varietdoctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury.  Generallyany hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists ithese kinds of problems.  DON'T WAIT, THOUGH.  GO SEE A DOCTORThe remainder of this information is paraphrased, without permission, froa wonderful report by New Zealand's Department of Labour (OccupationaSafety and Health Service): "Occupational Overuse Syndrome. Treatment anRehabilitation: A Practitioner\'s Guide"First, a glossary (or, fancy names for how you shouldn't have your hands)(note: you're likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors :  RSI: Repetitive Strain Injury - a general term for many kinds of injurie  OOS: Occupational Overuse Syndrome -- synonym for RS  CTD: Cumulative Trauma Disorder -- another synonym for RS  WRULD: Work-Related Upper Limb Disorders -- yet another synonym for RS  CTS: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (see below  Hyperextension:  Marked bending at a joint  Pronation: Turning the palm down  Wrist extension: Bending the wrist up  Supination: Turning the palm up  Wrist flexion: Bending the wrist down  Pinch grip: The grip used for a pencil  Ulnar deviation: Bending the wrist towards the little finger  Power grip: The grip used for a hammer  Radial Deviation: Bending the wrist toward the thumb  Abduction: Moving away from the body  Overspanning: Opening the fingers out wideNow then, problems come in two main types: Local conditions and diffusconditions.  Local problems are what you'd expect: specific musclestendons, tendon sheaths, nerves, etc. being inflamed or otherwise hurtDiffuse conditions, often mistaken for local problems, can involve muscldiscomfort, pain, burning and/or tingling; with identifiable areas otenderness in muscles, although they\'re not necessarily "the problem.--- Why does Occupational Overuse Syndrome occur?  Here's the theoryNormally, your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries whicpass among the muscle fibers.  When you tense a muscle, you restricthe blood flow.  By the time you're exerting 50% of your full poweryou're completely restricting your blood flowWithout fresh blood, your muscles use stored energy until they run outthen they switch to anaerobic (without oxygen) metabolism, which generatenasty by-products like lactic acid, which cause painOnce one muscle hurts, all its neighbors tense up, perhaps to relieve thload.  This makes sense for your normal sort of injury, but it only makethings worse with repetitive motion.  More tension means less blood flowand the cycle continuesAnother by-product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness froyour nerves.  They need blood tooAnyway, when you're typing too much, you're never really giving a changfor the blood to get back where it belongs, because your muscles neverelax enough to let the blood through.  Stress, poor posture, and pooergonomics, only make things worse--- Specific injuries you may have heard of(note: most injuries come in two flavors: acute and chronic.  Acutinjuries are severely painful and noticable.  Chronic conditions havless pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real.Tenosynovitis -- an inflamation of the tendon sheath.  Chronic tenosynovitioccurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent: not enough tcause acute inflamation, but enough to exceed the tendon sheath's abilitto lubricate the tendon.  As a result, the tendon sheath thickens, getinflamed, and you've got your problemTendonitis -- an inflammation of a tendon.  Repeated tensing of a tendocan cause inflamation.  Eventually, the fibers of the tendon start separatingand can even break, leaving behind debris which induces more friction, morswelling, and more pain.  "Sub-acute" tendonitis is more common, which entaila dull ache over the wrist and forearm, some tenderness, and it gets worswith repetitive activityCarpal Tunnel Syndrome -- the nerves that run through your wrist into youfingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them.  Symptoms includfeeling "pins and needles", tingling, numbness, and even loss of sensationCTS is often confused for a diffuse conditionAdverse Mechanical Tension -- also known as 'neural tension', this is wherthe nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possiblcompressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhereAMT can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other OOSdisorders.  It is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy(brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy)Others: for just about every part of your body, there's a fancy name foa way to injure it.  By now, you should be getting an idea of how OOconditions occur and why.  Just be careful: many inexperienced doctormisdiagnose problems as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, when in reality, yomay have a completely different problem.  Always get a second opiniobefore somebody does something drastic to you (like surgery)==4== Typing posture, ergonomics, prevention, treatmenThe most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reductension in the muscles and tendons.  This requires learning how to relaxIf you're under a load of stress, this is doubly important.  Tune outhe world and breath deep and regular.  Relaxing should become a guidinprinciple in your work: every three minutes take a three second breakEVERY THREE MINUTES, TAKE A THREE SECOND BREAK.  Really, do it everthree minutes.  It's also helpful to work in comfortable surroundingscalm down, and relaxIf you can't sleep, you really need to focus on this.  Rest, sleep, anrelaxation are really a big dealThere are all kinds of other treatments, of course.  Drugs can reducinflamation and pain.  Custom-molded splints can forcefully prevent baposture.  Surgery can fix some problems.  Exercise can help strengtheyour muscles.  Regular stretching can help prevent injury.  Good posturand a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension.  Ice or hot-colcontrast baths also reduce swelling.  Only your doctor can say what's besfor you--- Posture -- here are some basic guidelines.  [I so liked the way this wawritten in the New Zealand book that I'm lifting it almost verbatim froAppendix 10. -- dwallach. Let your shoulders relax. Let your elbows swing free. Keep your wrists straight. Pull your chin in to look down - don't flop your head forward. Keep the hollow in the base of your spine. Try leaning back in the chair. Don't slouch or slump forward. Alter your posture from time to time. Every 20 minutes, get up and bend your spine backwardSet the seat height, first.  Your feet should be flat on the floor.  Thereshould be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the kneesand your thighs should not slope too muchNow, draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortablto work at.  If you are short, this may be impossible.  The beest remedis to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using footrestNow, adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the spacbetween the backrest and the seat pan.  The backrest should support you ithe hollow of your back, so adjust its tilt to give firm support in thiareaIf you operate a keyboard, you will be able to spend more time leaninback, so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest, if available[Now, I diverge a little from the textA good chair makes a big difference.  If you don't like your chair, gfind a better one.  You really want adjustments for height, back angleback height, and maybe even seat tilt.  Most arm rests seem to get ithe way, although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arrests which you can also rotate out of the way.  You should find a goostore and play with all these chairs -- pick one that's right for youIn the San Francisco Bay Area, I highly recommend "Just Chairs."  Thname says it all--- Keyboard drawers, wrist pads, and keyboard replacementsThere is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right.  For sompeople, wrist pads seem to work wonders.  However, with good posture, yoshouldn't be resting your wrists on anything -- you would prefer youkeyboard to be "right there".  If you drop your arms at your side and thelift your hands up at the elbow, you want your keyboard under your handwhen your elbows are at about 90 degrees.  Of course, you want to avoipronation, wrist extension, and ulnar deviation at all costs.  Wrist padmay or may not help at this.  You should get somebody else to come anlook at how you work: how you sit, how you type, and how you relax.  It'often easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders odeviated handsSome argue that the normal, flat keyboard is antiquated and poorldesigned.

You are making precisely one of the points I wanted to makeI fully agree with you that there is a big distinction between th*process* of science and the end result. As an end result of science, one wants to get results that arobjectively verifiable.  But there is nothing objective about th*process* of science. If good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merito homeopathic remedies, this would certainly be valuable informationBut it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science.  Thiis where you and I disagree with Turpin.  In order to have science, onmust have a theoretical structure that makes sense, not a mercollection of empirically validated random hypothesesExperiment and empirical studies are an important part of science, buthey are merely the culmination of scientific research.  The mosimportant part of true scientific methodology is SCIENTIFIC THINKING. Without this, one does not have any hypotheses worth testing.  (Nohypotheses do not just leap out at you after you look at enough dataNor do they simply come to you in a flash one day while you're shaving olooking out the window.  At least not unless you've done a lot of reallgood thinking beforehand.) The difference between a Nobel Prize level scientist and a mediocrscientist does not lie in the quality of their empirical methodology. It depends on the quality of their THINKING. It really bothers me that so many graduate students seem to believe thathey are doing science merely because they are conducting empiricastudies.  And it bothers me even more that there are many fields, such acertain parts of psychology, where there seems to be no thinking at all,but mere studies testing ad hoc hypotheses. And I'm especially offended by Russell Turpin's repeated assertion thascience amounts to nothing more than avoiding mistakes.  Simply avoidinmistakes doesn't get you anywhere. -In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seemsless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.  lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitne

I am posting to this group in hopes of finding someone out there inetwork newsland who has heard of something similar to what I am gointo describe here.  I have a fourteen year old daugter who experiencea seizure on November 3, 1992 at 6:45AM after eating Kellog's FrosteFlakes.  She is perfectly healthy, had never experienced anything likthis before, and there is no history of seizures in either side of thfamily.  All the tests (EEG, MRI, EKG) came out negative so the decisiowas made to do nothing and just wait to see if it happened againWell, we were going along fine and the other morning, April 5, she haa bowl of another Kellog's frosted kind of cereal, Fruit Loops (I aembarrassed to admit that I even bought that junk but every oncin a while...) So I pour it in her bowl and think "Oh, oh, this is thsame kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure."  Tenminutes later she had a full blown seizures. This was her first exposurto a sugar coated cereal since the last seizureWhen I mentioned what she ate the first time as a possible reason fothe seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea.  Noafter this second episode, so similar in nature to the first, evehe is scratching his head.  Once again her EEG looks normal which understand can happen even when a person has a seizureOnce again we are waiting. I have been thinking that it would be gooto get to as large a group as possible to see if anyone has anexperience with this kind of thing.  I know that members of the medicacommunity are sometimes loathe to admit the importance that diet anfoods play in our general health and well-being.  Anyway, as you caguess, I am worried sick about this, and would appreciate any ideaanyone out there has.  Sorry to be so wordy but I wanted to really geacross what is going on hereThanks-Sharon Paulson                      s.s.paulson@larc.nasa.goNASA Langley Research CenteBldg. 1192D, Mailstop 156           Work: (804) 864-224Hampton, Virginia.  23681           Home: (804) 596-236

Extra-rationais a better phrase.  In fact, there are quite a number of well-known caseof extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful directionFor example, Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture oenantiomers (the origin of stereochemistry) partly because he liked friend's crank theory of chemical action.  The friend was wrong, buPasteur's discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich), lookinat the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because hlacked Pasteur's motivation to find something that distinguished racemiacid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acidAgain, Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomer(tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but becaushe was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  His notebookcontained fantasies of becoming the "Newton of mirror-image life," whiche never admitted publicallyPerhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.

Here is a press release from the Natural Resources Defense Council New Data Show About 100 Major U.S. Water Supplies Vulnerable TMilwaukee-Type Disease Outbrea To: National Desk, Environment Write Contact: Erik Olson or Sarah Silver, 202-783-7800, bot          of the Natural Resources Defense Counci   WASHINGTON, April 14  -- Internal EPA data releasetoday by the Natural Resources Defense Council reveals that abou100 large water systems -- serving cities from Boston to SaFrancisco -- do not filter to remove disease-carrying organismleaving those communities potentially vulnerable to a diseasoutbreak similar to the one affecting Milwaukee   The EPA list is attached   "These internal EPA documents reveal that the safety of watesupplies in many American cities is threatened by inadequatpollution controls or filtration," said Erik Olson, a senioattorney with NRDC.  "Water contamination isn\'t just a problem iBangladesh, it\'s also a problem in Bozeman and Boston.   "As of June 29, 1993, about 100 large surface water systems oEPA's list probably will be breaking the law.  The 1986 SafDrinking Water Act requires all surface water systems to eithefilter their water or fully protect the rivers or lakes they usfrom pollution," Olson continued.  Some systems are movintowards eventually implementing filtration systems but arexpected to miss the law's deadline   Olson pointed out that the threat of contamination is alreada reality in other cities.  A 1991 survey of 66 U.S. surfacwater systems by water utility scientists found that 87 percenof raw water samples contained the Milwaukee organiscryptosporidium, and 81 percent contained a similar parasitcalled giardia   Adding to the level of concern, a General Accounting Officstudy released today by House Health and Environment SubcommitteChairman Henry Waxman indicates serious deficiencies in thnation's system for conducting and following through on sanitarsurveys of water systems   "This new information raises a huge warning sign that millionof Americans can no longer simply turn on their taps and bassured that their water is safe to drink.  We must immediatelput into place programs to protect water sources frocontamination and where this is not assured, filtration equipmenmust be installed to protect the public," Olson noted.  "The timhas come for many of the nation's water utilities to stodragging their feet and to aggressively protect their water frocontamination; consumers are prepared to pay the modest costneeded to assure their water is safe to drink.

Anyway, turninthe thread around, the other day I played tennis during my lunchour.  I'm out of tennis shape so it was very intense exercise.  got overheated, and dehydrated.  Afterwards, I noticed a tinglinsensation all over my head then about 2 hours later, I could feea migraine start.  (I continued to drink water in the afternoon.I took cafergot, but it didn't help and the pain started althougit wasn't as intense as it usually is and about 9pm that night, thpain subsidedThis isn't the first time that I've had a migraine occur after exerciseI'm wondering if anyone else has had the same experience and I wondewhat triggers the migraine in this situation (heat buildup? dehydration?)I'm not giving up tennis so is there anything I can do (besides get intoshape and don't play at high noon) to prevent thisThanks--*********************************************************************Janet Jakstys         UUCP:{ames,mcdcup}!ntmtv!janeNorthern Telecom      INTERNET:janet@ntmtv.coMtn.

In most of this thread, I havbeen concerned with the difference between what is science anwhat is not.Lee Lady is correct when she asserts that the difference betweeEinstein and the average post-doc physicist is the quality otheir thought.  But what is the difference between Einstein and genius who would be a great scientist but whose great thoughtare scientifically screwy?  (Some would give Velikovsky oKorzybski as examples.  If you don't like these, choose youown.)  I say it is the same as the difference between the mediocrphysicist and the mediocre proponent of qi.  Both Einstein anthe mediocre physcists have disciplined their work from thcumulative knowledge of how previous researchers went wrongBoth Velikovsky and the mediocre proponent of qi have failed tdo this. Let me approach this from a second direction.  When one is asketo review a paper for a journal or conference, there are mankinds of criticism that one can make.  One kind of criticism ithat the work is just wrong or misinformed.  Another kind ocriticism is that the work, while technically correct, is eithenot important or not interesting.

Such "extra>rational" cases are curiosities -- not guides to methodologyAs has been noted before, there is the distinction between _motivationand _method_.  No experimental result should be accepted unless it idescribed in sufficient detail to be replicated, and the replicationdo indeed reproduce the result.  No theoretical argument should baccepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed, anreasonable, knowlegeable, people agree with the force of the logicBut people try experiments, and pursue arguments, for all sorts of crazreasons.  Irrational motivations are not just curiousities; they are large part of the history of scienceThere are a couple of negative points to make here1) A theory of qi could, conceivably, become accepted without direcverification of the existence of qi.  For example, quarks are an acceptepart of the standard model of physics, with no direct verification.  Whawould be needed would be a theory, based on qi, that predicted medicareality better than the alternatives.  The central theoretical claim coullie forever beyond experiment, as long as there was a sufficient body oexperimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other(I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi, thoughI don't think that there is even a coherent theory based on it, much lesa theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology.  And iis hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rathedirectly verifying the existence of qi.2) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rationaexperiment-data-theory sequence.  Most experiments are carried out, aninterpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks.  The theoreticacontroversies of the day determine which experiments get done.  Overallthere is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivationspetty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and whiccomputations, get done.  What keeps it going forward is the criticafunction of science: results don't count unless they can be replicatedThe whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test.  The generatpart can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properlyPasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystalsbut even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handedthat when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotatpolarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version waindistinguishable from tartaric acid.  Pasteur's irrational motivation haled to a replicable, and important, resultThis is where Lysenko, creationists, etc. fail.  They have usually noeven produced coherent theories that predict much of anything.  When theitheories do predict, and are contradicted by experiment, they do noconcede the point and modify their theories; rather they try to suppresthe results (Lysenko) or try to divert attention to other evidence thethink supports their position (creationists)--Mark A.

Avoiding mistakes is certainly highly desirable.  However it is alsowidely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativity.And in ordinary life, perfectionism carried beyond a certain point isindicative of a psychological disorder.  In the extreme case, a perfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he mightmake that he is unable to even leave the house. In science, we want to discover as much truth about the world as possibleand we also want to have as much certainty as possible about thesediscoveries.  Usually there is some trade-off between these two desiderata--- the search for scope and the search for certainty. If 18th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from Newton andLeibniz then there would probably be no calculus today, because neitherof the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense, sincethey lacked the concept of a limit.  And in fact, because of the lack ofa rigorous foundation, they made a number of errors in their use of calculus.It was only a hundred years later that Weistrass was able to give a solidgrounding for the ideas of Newton and Leibniz.  Nonetheless, what Newtonand Leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a greatdeal more from the application of their important ideas than it lostthrough the mistakes they made.     (Dick King) writes>  [ Somebody writes: >>I doubt if Einstein used any formal methodology.  ...>  ...>He also proposed numerous experiments which if performed would distinguish >universe in which special relativity holds from one in which it does not>         ...>Einstein played by the rules, which demand that hypotheses only be put ou>there if there exists a specific experiment that could disprove themThese are not the rules according to many who post to sci.med ansci.psychology.  According to these posters  "If it\'s not supported bcarefully designed controlled studies then it\'s not science.Taken to the extreme, I believe that the attitude that empirical studiesare everything and ideas are nothing results in a complete stultificationof science. For one thing, an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodologyresults in a sort of scientific trade-unionism, where those outsidethe establishment and lacking institutional or corporate support haveno chance to obtain a hearing.  (I don't in the least believe that thisis the intention of the arbiters of scientific methodology.  Nonetheless,it is one of the results.)   And although institutional science hascertainly produced many wonderful results, I think it is a foolisharrogance for scientists to believe that no one outside the establishment--- and using less than perfect empirical methodology --- will ever comewith anything worthwhile. Furthermore, the big bucks approach to science promotes what I think ione of the most significant errors in science:  choosing to investigatquestions because they can be readily handled by the currentlfashionable methodology (or because one can readily get institutionaor corporate sponsorship for them) instead of directing attention tthose questions which seem to have fundamental significanceFor instance, certain questions cannot be easily investigated witstatistical methods because the relevant factors are not quantitative(One could argue that this is the case for almost all questions in manareas of psychology.  In my opinion, a perusal of many of the paperresulting from the attempt by psychologists to force these questioninto a statistical framework gives the lie to Russell Turpin'assertion that current scientific methods "avoid all known errors."I think that asking the wrong question is probably the most fundamentalerror in science.  (Ignoring potentially valuable ideas is one of theothers.)  And I think that scientific journals are full of alltoo many studies done with impeccable empirical methods but which areworthless because the wrong question was asked in the first place. -In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seemsless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.  lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitne

Staying ione position too long is an ordeal.  Another major contributor to pain is thatendonitis has now developed (left thumb and hand with numbness at the base othe palm; bottom of feet; shoulders and outer thighs).  The tendonitis iquite painful yet my friend's doctor has not recommended any form of treatmento relieve itThe latest twist is that the doctor has dropped the anti-inflammatories and inow recommending Prednisone.  The hope is that the Prednisone will relieve somof the pain from the tendonitisMy friend is a 41 year old male who feels like he's 80 (his words, not mine)If anyone is aware of any new treatments for Psoriatic Arthritis, alternativcourses of action, support groups or literature on it, I would be extremelgrateful if you could e-mail to me.

   I have a BACK MACHINE and have had one since January.  While I have notfound it to be a panacea for my back pain, I think it has helped somewhat.It MAINLY acts to stretch muscles in the back and prevent spasms associatewith pain.  I am taking less pain medication than I was previously.    The folks at BACK TECHNOLOGIES are VERY reluctant to honor their returnpolicy.  They extended my "warranty" period rather than allow me to returnthe machine when, after the first month or so, I was not thrilled with it.They encouraged me to continue to use it, abeit less vigourously.

I love the FAQ.      The comment about contact lenses not being an option for any remainincorrection after RK and possibly after PRK is interresting.  Why ithis?  Does anyone know for sure whether this applies to PRK as wellAlso, why is it possible to get a correction in PRK with involvement oonly about 5% of the corneal depth, while RK is done to a depth of up t95%?  Why such a difference?  I thought the proceedures were simmilawith the exception of a laser being the cutting tool in PRK.  I must nobe understanding all of the differencesIn the FAQ, the vision was considered less clear after the surgery thawith glasses alone.  If this is completly attributable to thintentional slight undercorrection, then it can be compensated for whenecessary with glasses (or contacts, if they CAN be worn afterall!).

Since I\'ve addressed these issues in thinewsgroup in the not too distant past, I won't go into them again nowWhat is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives thimpression (and you may not in fact hold this view) that the common (perhapeven the "correct") approach for a scientist to follow is to sit arounhaving flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies anpetty hatreds.  It further at least implicitly advances the position thasciences goes "forward" (and it is not clear what this means given thcontext in which it occurs) by generating in a completely non-rationaand even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are theweeded out via the "critical function" of science.  (Though why this criticafunction should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mysteryIf experimental design, hypotheses creation, and theory construction arsubject to jealousies and petty hatreds, then this must be equally truof the application of any "critical function" concerning replicationThis is what leads one (ala Feyerabend) to an "anything goes" view.True, the generation part *can* be totally irrational.

ALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY, THIS IS NOT LIMITED TOUNIVERSITY STUDENTS #######################################################################################   New Program Announcement   #############################################################################################            JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAThe Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a neprogram jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie MellonUniversity.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientificcommunitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 andJanuary 1994PROGRAM OBJECTIVEThe program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and theUnited States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managerexperience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This isfacilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities anlaboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develolong-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterpartsPROGRAM DESIGTo fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required todevelop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan anits culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGSeveral Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive coursedesigned to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in relatively short time2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURA particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of thcultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches inmanufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in avariety of departments throughout both universities including AnthropologySociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiumwill be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing orresearch facilities in the United States will be scheduled3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAUpon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU,participants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observeand participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japawill generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possibleFELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL ASTIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE        FOR MORE INFORMATION AND APPLICATION MATERIALS CONTACSTEVEN BRENER\t\t\t\tSUSIE BROWJSTMP\t\t\t\t\tCarnegie Mellon University, GSIUniversity of Pittsburgh\t\tPittsburgh, PA 15213-3894E25 Forbes Quadrangle\t\t\tTelephone: (412) 268-780Pittsburgh, PA 15260\t\t\tFAX:\t   (412) 268-816Telephone: (412) 648-7414\t\FAX:       (412) 648-2199\t\#######################################################################################################################################################Interested individuals, companies and institutions should respond by phone omail.

We went off to the doctor to see if should worry about the fact that my foot was now about 3 times it's normasize.  (And itched!!!  Ow!)  He basically said I shouldn't this time, buthat bee sting allergy was not something you tended to get aclimatized tobut were something that each time got progressively worse generally and thanext time could be the time I go into anaphylactic shock.  Admittedly thiwas many years ago when I was young.  Since then I just make sure I don'get stung.  I also should carry a bee sting kit with me, but I don't. This isn't scientific or proof, but this would lead me to believe it's not different reaction, just a different degree of reaction.  Allergies worthat way.  People have various reactions.  Sort of like diabetes, sompeople can get by with just monitoring their diet, others have to monitotheir diet and use insulin sometimes while others have to watch their dielike a hawk and use insulin regularly. I think MSG is probably similar...some people have allergic reactions tit.  Some people are allergic to fermented things and can't use sosauce...but the chinese have been using it for centuries... that doesn'necessarily mean that it's safe for everyone. \tJohannturner@reed.ed

I need advice with a situation which occurred between me and a physicawhich upset me.  I saw this doctor for a problem with recurring painHe suggested medication and a course of treatment, and told me that need to call him 7 days after I begin the medication so that he mamonitor its effectiveness, as well as my general healthI did exactly as he asked, and made the call (reaching his secretary)I explained to her that I was following up at the doctor's requestand that I was worried because the pain episodes were becoming morfrequent and the medication did not seem effectiveThe doctor called me back, and his first words were, "Whatever you wantyou'd better make it quick.  I'm very busy and don't have time to chitchat with you!"  I told him I was simply following his instructions tcall on the 7th day to status him, and that I was feeling worse.  Ithen asked if perhaps there was a better time for us to talk when hhad more time.  He responded, "Just spit it out now because no time ia good time."  (Said in a raised voice.)  I started to feel upset antried to explain quickly what was going on with my condition but mnervousness interfered with my choice of words and I kind of stuttereand then said "well, never mind" and he said he\'ll talk to varioucolleagues about other medications and he'll call me some other timeThis doctor called me that evening and said because I didn't expresmyself well, he was confused about what I wanted.  At this point was pretty upset and I told him (in an amazingly polite voice considerinhow angry I felt) that his earlier manner had hurt my feelings.  He tolme that he just doesn\'t have time to "rap with patients" and thoughthat was what I wanted.  I told him that to assume I was calling t"rap" was insulting, and said again that I was just following througon his orders.  He responded that he resented the implication that hefelt I was making that he was not interested in learning about what hipatients have to say about their condition status.  He then gave mthis apology: "I am sorry that there was a miscommunication and yomistakenly thought I was insulting.  I am not trying to insult yobut I am not that knowledgeable about pain, and I don't have a lot otime to deal with that."  He then told me to call him the next dafor further instructions on how do deal with my pain and medicationI am still upset and have not yet calledMy questions: (1) Should I continue to have this doctor manage my care(2) Since I am in pain off and on, I realize that this may cause me tbe more anxietous so am I perhaps over-reacting or overly sensitiveIf this doctor refers me to his colleague who knows more about the typof pain I have, he still wants me to status him on my condition bunow I am afraid to call him\t\t\t--Marlen

In normal condition, the concentration of glutamate in the cerebrospinal fluid is about2 uM that is high enough to activate one type of glutamate receptor-the NMDreceptor. But the question is Neuron and glial cell in the brain have a lots of transport to get glutamate into Neuron or glial. So no one know exact concentration of glutamate is around neurons.Glutamate is most important neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. It is involved in not only in daily life like the controling of movement, it is alsoinvolved in develpoment, memory and learn (it is involved in Logn-term potentialtion that be thought is the basis of learning).

    INTENSIVE JAPANESE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH THIS SUMME    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^The University of Pittsburgh is offering two intensive Japanese languagcourses this summer.  Both courses, Intensive Elementary Japanese andIntensive Intermediate Japanese, are ten week, ten credit courseseach equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study.  They beginJune 7 and end August 13.  The courses meet five days per week, five hoursper day.  There is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course. Fellowships available for science and engineering students.  ContactSteven Brener, Program Manager of the Japanese Science and TechnologManagement Program, at the University of Pittsburgh at the number oaddress below. ALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY, THIS IS NOT LIMITED TOUNIVERSITY STUDENTS #######################################################################################   New Program Announcement   #############################################################################################            JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAThe Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a neprogram jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie MellonUniversity.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientificcommunitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 andJanuary 1994PROGRAM OBJECTIVEThe program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and theUnited States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managerexperience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This isfacilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities anlaboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develolong-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterpartsPROGRAM DESIGTo fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required todevelop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan anits culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGSeveral Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive coursedesigned to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in relatively short time2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURA particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of thcultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches inmanufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in avariety of departments throughout both universities including AnthropologySociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiumwill be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing orresearch facilities in the United States will be scheduled3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAUpon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU,participants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observeand participate in the management of technology.

He was having about one seizure per week.  She reported thashe did this on Thursday (3/11), he had a seizure on Saturday and thewent 4 weeks without a seizure!!  On Easter he went to Grandma's and atecandy, pop - anything he wanted.  He had a seizure the next day.  Shesees sensitivity to nutrasweet, sugar, colors, caffine and corn.  Witcorn she says, he gets very nervous and aggresive. With my own daughter (age 7) , I think she is also sensitive and stayaway from those foods on her own.  She has never had gum, won't eacandy, prefers an apple to a cookie, doesn't like chocolate and won'even use toothpaste!!!  Her brother, on the other hand, is a junk fooaddict! Hope this helps.

Although not many patients with Hep B go on tchronic hepatitis, it does still occur in a good number (20%?) and isomething to keep in mind.  Hepatitis C (was: non-A, non-B Hep) mucmore frequently leads to chronic hep and cirrhosis.  There is also aautimmune chronic hepatitis that affects mostly younger women whicalso leads to cirrhosis. Of course, cirrhosis is a most unkind disease.  The most dangeroueffects relate to portal hypertension and loss of liver function.Patients develop life-threatening variceal bleeds and hepatic comasamong many other problems, as a result of disturbances in hepaticirculation.  Less ominously, they can exhibit the effects ohyperestrogenemia which often characterize patients with cirrhosis.These effects include telangiactasias (small red skin lesions) and, imen, gynecomastia (breast development).  The only real treatment focirrhosis is liver transplantKeep in mind that cirrhosis is not expected, at least statistically, iyour friend's case.  Nevertheless you might want to bring up thsubject of chronic disease and cirrhosis with the doctor.  Hopefully hor she can then carefully explain these sequelae of Hep B infection tyou, and offer you supportSimon.

She would touch her head and strands of hair wouljust fall right out. (by the way, she is 29 or 30 years old). It continued to occur until she had a bald spot about thsize of a half dollar.  Since that time, she  has gotten twmore bald spots of the same size.  Other symptoms she'described include:  several months of an irregular menstruacycle (which is strange for her, because she has always beeextremely regular); laryngitis every few days -- she will wakup one morning and have almost no voice, and then the next dait's fine; dizzy spells -- she claims that she's had 4 or very bad dizzy spells early in the morning, including one thaknocked her to the ground; and general fatigueShe went to a dermatologist first who couldn't find any reasofor the symptoms and sent her to an internist who suspectethyroid problems.  He did the blood work and claims that everythincame back normal. She's very concerned and very confused.  Does anyone have anideas or suggestions?  I told her that I thought she shoulsee an endocrinologist.  Does that sound like the right idea** By the way, in case you are going to ask...no, she has recentltaken any medications that would cause these symptoms...no, she hasn'recently changed her hair products and she hasn't gotten a perm,coloring, or other chemical process that might cause hair to faloutThanks in advance for any help

This has beean ellusive matter for researchers, and is one of the fundamental requirementfor many to acknowledge an agent as being causitive of a particular diseaseUp to now, only the vaccine manufacturer has been able to "prove" thathe disease existsThis paper is noteworthy in two other regards1) None of the animals they infected were treated in any way.

Except when someone else has cooked a meal for meI only eat fruit, vegetables, and whole grain or bran cereals.  estimate I only get about 5 to 10 percent of my calories from fatVery little sugar or saltVery high fiber.  Most Americans get about 10 grams.  25 to 35 arrecommended.  I get between 50 and 150.  Sometimes 200.  (I've hearof people taking fiber pills.  It seems unlikely that pills cacontain enough fiber to make a difference.  It would be about alikely as someone getting fat by popping fat pills.  Tablets arjust too small, unless you snarf down hundreds of them daily.My "clean your plate" conditioning works *for* me.  Eating the las10% takes half my eating time, and gives satiety a chance to catcup, so I don't still feel hungry and go start eating something elseI don't eat when I'm not hungry (unless I'm sure I'll get hungrshortly, and eating won't be practical then)I bike to work, 22 miles a day, year round.  Fast.  I also bike tstores, movies, and everywhere else, as I've never owned a carI estimate this burns about 1000 calories a day.  It also helpbuild and maintain muscle mass, prevent insulin resistance (diabeteruns in my family), and increase my metabolism.  (Even so, mmetabolism is so low that when I'm at rest I'm most comfortablwith a temperature in the 90s (F), and usually wear a sweater iit drops to 80.)  Cycling also motivates me to avoid every excesounce.  (Cyclists routinely pay a premium for cycling products thaweigh slightly less than others.  But it's easier and cheaper to triweight from the rider than from the vehicle.There's no question in my mind that my metabolism is radicalldifferent from that of most people who have never been fat.  Fortunatelyit isn't different in a way that precludes excellent healthObviously, I can't swear that every obese person who does what I'vdone will have the success I did.  But I've never yet heard of one whdid try it and didn't succeed> I think all of us cycle.  One's success depends on how large th> fluctuations in the cycle are.  Some people can cycle only 5 poundsI'm sure everyone's weight cycles, whether or not they've ever been fatI usually eat extremely little salt.

Phenylketonuria is a disease in which the body cannot process phenylalanineIt can build up in the blood and cause seizures and neurological damageAn odd side effect is that the urine can be deeply colored, like red winePeople with the condition must avoid Nutrasweet, chocolate, and anythinelse rich in phenylalanineAspartame is accused of having caused various vague neurological symptomsPat Robertson's program _The_700_Club_ was beating the drum againsaspartame rather vigorously for about a year, but that issue seems thave been pushed to the back burner for the last year or so.

Nutrasweet is a synthetic sweetener a couple thousand times sweeter thasugar.  Some people are concerned about the chemicals that the  body produceswhen it degrades nutrasweet.  It is thought to form formaldehyde and known tfor methanol in the degredation pathway that the body uses to eliminatesubstances.  The real issue is whether the levels of methanol and formaldehydproduced are high enough to cause significant damage, as both are toxic tliving cells.  All I can say is that I will not consume it. Phenylalanine inothing for you to worry about.  It is an amino acid, and everyone uses smalquantities of it for protein synthesis in the body.  Some people have a diseasknown as phenylketoneurea, and they are missing the enzyme necessary todegrade this compound and eliminate it from the body.  For them, it willaccumulate in the body, and in high levels this is toxic to growing nervcells.  Therefore, it is Only a major problem in young children (until arounage 10 or so) or women who are pregnant and have this disorder.  It used tbe a leading cause of brain damage in infants, but now it can be easilydetected at birth, and then one must simply avoid comsumption of phenylalaninas a child, or when pregnant. -heathe

Scientific intuition is not something one is born with.  It is somethinthat one learns.  Maybe we don't understand completely how it is learnedbut training in systematic scientific thinking is certainly one of thekey elements in developing it. Informal exploration is also often an important element in finding nescientific ideas.  One thinks, for instance, of Darwin's naturalististudies in the Galapagos islands, which led him to the ideas for thetheory of evolution. This is why I am offended by a definition of science that emphasizeempirical verification and does not recognize thinking and informaexploration as important scientific work.

No TV weatherman can match us. This time we not only scoredagain, but we were also able to disable the Long IslandRailroad, making travel REALLY difficult.  None the less, manybraved the snow and we had an interesting meeting and goodconversation.  Our scheduled speaker, Mrs. Elizabeth Linnehan,a professional nutritionist, had a family emergency and was notable to attend.  She hope she will be with us in the fall todiscuss diet and medications.  However,  Ms. Jennifer Friedman,an image consultant and sister of a liver transplant recipientwas kind enough to step in on very short notice.  Ms. Friedmangave us a lot of good advice about choosing clothes and makeup,(even a bit for men) to help us look well and healthy and tominimize some of the cosmetic effects of some of the medicineand drugs we take.  We are most grateful to Jennifer and thankher for an entertaining eveningANNUAL MEETINIn addition to welcoming Dr. Teperman, the April meeting isalso the Annual meeting of the Chapter.

This is a consequence of its oxidation to formaldehydand formic acid, two quite reactive compounds which at high enough levelcan damage tissues like the retina and kidney, because at such high dosethe body's detoxification system is overwhelmed.  Interestingly, ontreatment for early methanol poisoning is to get the person drunk oethyl alcohol--vodka or an equivalent.

And I still disagree with yourcontention that nobody who doesn\'t use methods deemed "scientific"can possibly know what's true and what's not. >  [Deleted material which I agree with.] >Back to Lee Lady>> These are not the rules according to many who post to sci.med an>> sci.psychology.

(T>reuse the previous example, we know that conclusions fro>uncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medica>problems are notoriously problematic.) Okay, so let's see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degreesof certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefullycontrolled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to theextent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certaintreatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, evenif uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement thaa treatment is useful.  This is often the best evidence we can hope fofrom investigators who do not have institutional or corporate supportIn this case, it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as crediblbut to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who arqualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testingSECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards ofevidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal. I come to this dispute about what science is  not only as mathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (anoccasionally in sci.med) about NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming).  Mucof the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized ainformal exploration than as careful scientific research.  For yearnow I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists tjust take a look at it, to read a few of the books and watch some othe videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  Not fothe purpose of making a definitive judgement, but simply to look at thNLP methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information frosubjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be oscientific interest.  And most especially to be aware of th*questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientifiinvestigationOver and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  "If thihasn't been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empiricaresearch then it can\'t be of any interest to us." To me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme "There\'ve got tbe controlled studies" position is an NLP technique called the FasPhobia/Trauma CureSimple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world's mostimportant psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is thatit doesn't take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tellwhen someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simplevisualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim thait can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence iuseful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentialla variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioratherapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique onc(or, in the case of PTSD, once for each traumatic incident).  Thprocess doesn't need to be repeated and the subject doesn't need tpractice it over again at homeNow to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure.(Especially if, as NLPers claim, the success rate is extremely high.) Take someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them upto a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15minutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up tothe balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in afew weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long termfollow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of vieweven a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case,there are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the bestof my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversedafter holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure, incidentally, was donwith a slightly different NLP technique, before I learned of the FastPhobia/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now, I enjoy living on the 17tfloor of my building and having a large balcony.) The folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not tmake this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome studwill be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners,many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can illafford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, becausethe whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they're not part of thscientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gainfrom scientific acceptance.)The Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinicalpsychology establishment is still saying "We don\'t have any way ofknowing that it\'s effective." These academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborateas anyone could want, of course, but they say  "Why should I prove yourtheory?"  and  "The burden of proof is on the one making the claim." One academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completelyunscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn'tbeen described in a scientific journal.  (It's described in a number ofbooks and I've posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as muchdetail as I'm capable of.) Actually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (withfavorable results), but it's apparently not acceptable because it's doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journalTo me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it. This is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about "doctrinnaire"attitudes about science. Now maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, Russell. If so, I apologize.-In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seemsless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.  lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitne

This reminds me of the last Graham Kerr cooking show I saw.  Today hsmoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot!  He used a strange techniquI'd never seen beforeHe took a big pot with lid, and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foilThe tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee-table ash traymade by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edgesIn the tray, he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar, a similaquantity of brown rice (he said any rice will do), the contents of twteabags of Earl Grey tea, and a few clovesOn top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket-type steamer, wittwo chicken breasts in it.  The lid was put on, and the whole assemblwent on the stovetop at high heat for 10 or 12 minutesLater, he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts.  What surpriseand concerns me are1)  No wood chips.  Where does the smoke flavor come from2)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember hearing that carmel colo    (obtained by caramelizing sugar -- a common coloring and flavorin    agent) had been found to be carcinogenic.  I believe they injecte    it under the skin of rats, or something.  If the results were conclusive    caramel color would not be legal in the U.S., yet it is still bein    used.  Was the initial research result found to be incorrect, or what3)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember Earl Grey tea being implicate    as carcinogenic, because it contains oil of bergamot (an extrac    from the skin of a type of citrus fruit).  Does anyone know whateve    happened with that story?  If it were carcinogenic, Earl Grey te    could not have it as an additive, yet it apparently continues to d    soWRT natural wood smoke (I've smoking a duck right now, as it happens)I've noticed that a heavily-smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangtaste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recentlstopped flowing.  I find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chipsgetting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking processthen slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chipsMy theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low-molecular weighstuff, like terpenes, and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sorof larger molecule more similar to tar.  The long barbeque time aftethe initial intensive smoke drives off the low-molecular weight stuffjust leaving the flavor behind.  Does anyone know if my theory is correctI also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat drippinon the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic.  For that reason, and becausit covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess, I only grilnon-drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals.  I do stuff like thiduck by indirect heat.  I have a long rectangular Weber, and I put the coalat one end and the meat at the other end.  The fat drops directly on thfloor below the meat, and next time I use the barbeque I make the firin that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coalsAnd yet another reason I've heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is thasmoked cured meat, like pork sausage and bacon, containnitrosamines, which are carcinogenic.  I'm pretty sure this claim actuallhas some standing, don't know about the othersAn amusing incident I recall was the Duncan Hines scandal, when it wadiscovered that the people who make Duncan Hines cake mix were puttina lot of ethylene dibromide (EDB) into the cake mix to suppress weevilsThis is a fumigant which is known to be carcinogenicThe guy who represented the company in the press conference defendehimself by saying that the risk from eating Duncan Hines products every dafor a year would be equal to the cancer risk from eating two charcoalbroiled steaks.  What a great analogy!  When I first heard that, mimmediate reaction was we should make that a standard unit!  One charcoabroiled steak would be equivalent to 0.5 Duncans

[...   In the September 1992 issue of THE TUFTS UNIVERSITY DIET AND NUTRITIO   LETTER, there is a three page article about artificial sweeteners.  Wha   follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with Nutrasweet   [Reproduced without permission\t   The controversy [over aspartame] began six years ago in England\twhere a group of researchers found that aspartame, marketed unde\tthe tradename Nutrasweet, appears to stimulate appetite and\tpresumably, the eating of more calories in the long run than i\ta person simply consumed sugar.  When researchers asked a grou\tof 95 people to drink plain water, aspartame-sweetened water, an\tsugared water, they said that overall they felt hungriest afte\tdrinking the artificially sweetened beverage\t   The study received widespread media attention and stirred \tgood deal of concern among the artificial-sweetener-using public\tHowever, its results were questionable at best, since the researcher\tdid not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite di\tactually translate into an increase in eating.  The two do no\tnecessarily go hand in hand\t   In the years that followed, more than a dozen studies examinin\tthe effect of aspartame on appetite -- and eating -- were conducted\tAnd after reviewing every one of them, the director of th\tLaboratory of the Study of Human Ingestive Behavior at Johns Hopkin\tUniversity, Barbara Rolls, Ph.D., concluded that consuming aspartame\tsweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase i\tthe amount of food eaten afterward\t   One artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causin\tcancer is aspartame.  But it most certainly has been blamed for \thost of other ills.  Since its introduction in 1981, the governmen\thas received thousands of complaints accusing it of causin\teverything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxiety\tStill, years of careful scientific study conducted both before an\tafter the sweetener's entering the market have failed to confir\tthat it can bring about adverse health effects.  That's why th\tCenters for Disease Control (the government agency charged wit\tmonitoring public health), the American Medical Association'\tCouncil on Scientific Affairs, and the Food and Drug Administratio\thave given aspartame, one of the most studied food additives, \tclean bill of health\t   Granted, the FDA has set forth an "acceptable daily intake" o\t50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight.  To excee\tthe limit, however, a 120-pound (55 kg.) woman would have to tak\tin 2,750 milligrams of aspartame -- the amount in 15 cans o\taspartame-sweetened soda pop, 14 cups of gelatin, 22 cups of yogurt\tor 55 six-ounce servings of aspartame-containing hot cocoa,..\tA 175-pound (80 kg.) man would have to consume some 4,000 milligram\tof the sweetener -- the amount in 22 cans of soda pop or 32 cup\tof yogurt -- to go over the limit.  [chart with aspartame conten\tof selected foods omitted\t   Only one small group of people must be certain to stay awa\tfrom aspartame: those born with a rare metabolic disorder calle\tphenylketonuria, or PKU.  The estimated one person in every 12,00\tto 15,000 who has it is unable to properly metabolize an essentia\tamino acid in aspartame called phenylalanine.  Once a chil\tconsumes it, it builds up in the body and can ultimately caus\tsuch severe problems as mental retardation.

Does anone have any informatioI\'m not sure that this condition is "recognised" anywhere (in thsense of a disease with diagnostic criteria, clear boundariebetween it and other diseases, unique pathologic or physiologifeatures, etc), but here goes with what many neurologists agree onPost-polio syndrome patients have evidence of motor neuron diseasby clinical examination, EMG, and muscle biopsy.  The abnormalitieare mostly chronic (due to old polio) but there is evidence oongoing deterioration.  Clinically, the patients complain odeclining strength and endurance with everyday motor tasksMusculoskeletal pain is a nearly universal feature that doubtlescontributes to the impaired performance.  The examination showmuscle weakness and atrophy.  The EMG shows evidence of oldenervation with reinnervation (giant and long-duration motor uniaction potentials) *and* evidence of active denervatio(fibrillation potentials).  The biopsy also shows old denervatiowith reinnervation (fiber-type grouping) *and* evidence of activdenervation (small, angulated fibers with dense oxidative enzymstaining) - but curiously, little or no group atrophyPost-polio patients do not have ALS.  In ALS, there is clinicallevident deterioration from one month to the next.  In post-poliothe patients are remarkably stable in objective findings from onyear to the next.  Of course, there are patients who had polibefore who develop genuine ALS, but ALS is no more common amonpolio survivors than among people who never had polioThe cause of post-polio syndrome is unknown.  There is littlevidence that post-polio patients have active polio virus odestructive immunologic response to virus antigenThere is no solid evidence that patients with post-polio havanything different happening to the motor unit (anterior horn cellsmotor axons, neuromuscular junctions, and muscle fibers) thapatients with old polio who are not complaining of deteriorationBoth groups can have the same EMG and biopsy findings.

Possibly spinal motor neurons (that have reinnervated hugnumbers of muscle fibers) start shedding the load after severayearsThere are a couple of clinical features that distinguish post-polisyndrome patients from patients with old polio who dendeterioration.  The PPS patients are more likely to have had severpolio.  The PPS patients are *much* more likely to complain of painThey also tend to score higher on depression scales oneuropsychologic testsMy take on this (I'm sure some will disagree):  after recovery frosevere polio there can be abnormal loading on muscles, tendonsligaments, bones, and joints, that leads to inflammatory and/odegenerative conditions affecting these structures.  The increasinpain, superimposed on the chronic (but unchanging) weakness, leadto progressive impairment of motor performance and ADL.  I aperhaps biased by personal experience of having never seen a PPpatient who was not limited in some way by pain.

Using geneti;engineering, we will be able to insert whatever genes we want;No breeding, no "hybrids", etc.  The ethical question is, shoul;weTwo past problems with eugenics have been1) reducing the gene pool and2) defining the status of the eugenizedInserting genes would not seem to reduce the gene pool unless the insertegenes later became transmissible to progeny. Then they may be able tcrowd out "garbage genes." This may in the future become possible. Even iit does, awareness of the need to maintain the gene pool would hopefullmean provisions will be made for saving genes that may come in handlater. Evidently the genes for sickle cell disease in equatorial Africand for diabetes in the Hopi *promoted* survival in some conditions. Wdon't really know what the future may hold for our environment. Threduced wilderness- and disease-survival capacity of our relatively inbredomesticated animals comes to mind. Vulcanism, nuclear winter, ice agemeteor impact, new microbiological threats, famine, global warming, etc.etc., are all conceivable. Therefore, having as many genes as possiblavailable is a good strategy for species survival.Of course, the status of genetically altered individuals would start ouas no different than anyone else's. But if we could mak"philosopher-kings" with great bodies and long lives, would we (or theywant to give them elevated status? We could. The Romans did it with theikings *without* the benefits of such eugenics. The race eventuallrealized and dealt with the problems which that caused, but for a whileit was a problem. Orwell introduced us to the notion of what might happeto persons genetically altered for more menial tasks. But there is nothinnew under the sun. We treated slaves the same way for millennia befor"1984."  I see no inherent problem with gene therapy which avoids at least these problems. Humans have always had trouble having the virtue and wisdom tuse any power that falls into their hands to good ends all the time. Thahasn't stopped the race as a whole yet. Many are the civilizations whichave died from inability to adapt to environmental change. However, alsmany are the civilizations which have died from the abuse of their owpower. The ones which survived have hopefully learned a lesson from thfates of others, and have survived by making better choices when theiturns cameNot that I don't think that this gene altering power couldn't wipe us ofthe face of the earth or cause endless suffering. Nuclear power or globawarming or whatever could and may still do that, too.The real issue is an issue of wisdom and virtue. I personally don't thinman has enough wisdom and virtue to pull this next challenge off anbetter than he did the for last few. We, as eugenists, may make it, an wmay not. If we don\'t, I hope there are reservoirs of "garbage" people ouin some backwater with otherwise long discarded "garbage" genes which wilpull us through.I believe that the real problem is and will probably always be the sameMan needs to accept input from the great spirit of God to overcome hilacks in the area of knowing how to use the power he has. Some men haveand I believe all men may, listen to and obey the still small voice of Goin their hearts. This is the way to begin to recieve the wisdom and virtuneeded to escape the problems consequent to poor choices. Peoples havdied out for many reasons. The societies which failed to accept enouginput from God to safely use the power they had developed have destroyethemselves, and often others in the process. It is self-evident that thones which survive today have either accepted enough input from the Spirito use their powers wisely enough to avoid or survive their own mistakethus far, or else haven't had enough power for long enough.In summary, I would say that the question of whether to use this netechnology is really an ancient one.

It *does>imply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reasoning ar>incapable of discovering *which* treatments are effective an>which are not.To start with, no methodology or form of reasoning is infallible.  Sthere's a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in given context.  Insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completeland makes progress impossible.  (Expenditure of sufficiently large sumof money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this.)  On the othehand, with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results whiceventually turn out to be false.  There is a morass of studiecontradicting other studies and outsiders start saying  "You people calTHIS science?"   (My opinion, for what it\'s worth, is that one sees botthese phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology.) Some subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigoappropriate for a particular investigation.  I don't believe it isever possible to banish subjective judgement from science. My second point, though, is that highly capable people can often makextremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when usinmethodology considered inadequate by the usual standards.  I think thiis true of many scientists and I think it is true of many who approactheir discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientificWithin mathematics, I think there are several examples, especially beforthe twentieth century.  One conspicuous case is that of Riemann, who ifamous for many theorems he stated but did not prove.  (Latermathematicians did prove them, of course.) I think that for a good scientist, empirical investigation is often noso much a matter of determining what is true and what's not  as it is amatter of convincing other people.  (People have proposed lots ofincompatible definitions of science here, but I think the ability toobjectively convince others of the validity of one's results is aessential element.  Not that one can necessarily do that at every stepof the scientific process, but I think that if one is not moving towardthat goal then one is not doing science.When a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does anseems to be very successful at it, I think that his judgements are alsworthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth furtheinvestigation. > Namely, is there really justification for the belief tha> science is a superior path to truth than non-scientific approaches? Admittedly, my question was not at all well posed.  A considerablamount of effort in a "serious scholarly investigation" such as suggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriatelyspecific question to try and answer. The "science" I was thinking of in my question is the actual sciencecurrently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century. I certainly wasn't thinking of some idealized science or the mere useof "reason and observation.One thing I had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whethein many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experiencepractitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies. Since Russell Turpin seems to be much more familiar than I am witthe study of scientific methodology, perhaps he can tell us if thereis any existing research related to this question. -In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seemsless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.  lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitne

As promised, below is a personal critique of a Pressure Point MassagerI recently bought from the Self Care Catalog.  I am very pleased withthe results.  The catalog description is as follows\tThe Pressure Point Massager is an aggressive physical massager\tthat actually kneads the tension out of muscles ... much like \tprofessional shiatsu masseur.  The powerful motor drives tw\tcounter-rotating "thumbs" that move in one-inch orbits -\treleasing tension in the neck, back, legs and arms\tPressure Point Massager    A2623   $10To order or receive a catalog, call (24 hours, 7 days) 1-800-345-3371 ofax at 1-800-345-4021*******NOTEWhen I ordered the massager, the item number was different, and the pricwas $179, not $109.  When I received it, I glanced thru the newer cataloenclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one.  I was QUITE annoyed to see a $70 difference in price.  I called them about itand the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers, although ilooks and works exactly the same.  He told me to go ahead and return thfirst one and order the cheaper one, using the price difference as reason for return.  In fact, since the newer ones might take a while tship from the factory (I received this one in 3 days), he told me I coulduse the one I already have until the new one arrives, then return the oldone.  VERY reasonable people*******I have long-term neck, shoulder and back pain (if I were a building, Iwould be described as "structurally unsound :-) ).  I have stretchesand exercises to do that help, but the problem never really goes away. If, for whatever reason, I do not exercise for a while (illness, not enougtime, lazy, etc.), the muscles become quite stiff and painful and, thus,more prone to further strain.  Even with exercise, I sometimes requirephysical therapy to get back on track, which 1st requires a doctor visitto get the prescription for p.t. The tension in my neck, if not released, eventually causes a headach(sometimes confused with a sinus headache) over my left eye.  When myphysical therapist has massaged my neck, and the sub-occipital musclesin particular (the 2 knobby areas near the base of the skull), theheadache usually eased within a day, although it hurts like hell towhile it is being massagedI ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what I was wishinsomeone would invent --a machine that would massage, NOT VIBRATE, myneck and sub-occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done inthe past, that I could use by myself.  No doctor visit or inconvenientp.t. appts for a week later would be needed to use it.  I could get upin the middle of the night and use it, if necessaryI have been using it for about a week or so now, and LOVE it.  The basunit is about a 14" x 9" rectangle, about 3-3/4" high, with handles on eacside, and it plugs into an average outlet.  The two metal "thumbs" are about1-1/2" in diameter and protrude about 2-1/2" above the base.  The thumbsare covered with a gray cloth that is non-removable.  They are located moretoward one end, rather than centered (see figure below).  They move ineither clockwise or counter-clockwise directions, depending on which sideof the switch is pushed, and are very quiet.  It can be used from eitheside.  For instance, the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the necor the top of the neck, depending on which direction you approach it                 ______________________________                |  __    _______________    __                  | |  |  |\t\t|  |  |                 | |  |  |  \\^^/   \\^^/  |  |  |                 | |  |  |   ||     ||   |  |  |                 | |  |  |\t\t|  |  |                 | |  |  |_______________|  |  |                 | |__|\t\t\t   |__|                 |_______________________________For the neck/head, the user varies the amount of pressure used by (iflaying down) allowing all or part of the full weight of the head and/orneck to rest on the thumbs.  The handles can also be used if sitting ostanding, applying pressure with the arms/wrists.  Since my wrists aralso impaired (I'm typing this over an extended period of time), and Idon't have someone living with me who can apply it, laying down workswell for meFor my back, I sit in a high-backed kitchen chair, position the massagebehind me at whatever point I want massaged, and lean back lightly (onot so lightly) against it.  The pressure of leaning back holds it in place. If I want to massage the entire spine, I simply move it down a few incheswhenever I feel like it.  For my back, this machine is far superior to usethan the commonly used "home-made" massager of 2 tennis balls taped together(with the balls, position (against a wall or door) them over the spine andmove the body up and down against them).  The tennis balls are better thannothing, but difficult to use for very long, especially if your quads arenot in good shape, and my long hair gets (painfully) in the way if I don'tpin it up first.  As far as I'm concerned, the easier something like thisis to use, the more likely I'll use/do it.  If there are multipleconsiderations/hassles, I'm more likely to not bother with itNot only has this machine helped with my headaches, but my range of motionfor my neck and back are greatly increased.  The first time I used it on mneck/sub-occipital muscles, however, I overdid it and pressed too haragainst it, which resulted in a very tender, almost bruised area for few days.  I laid off it for about 3 days and applied ice, which helped. After that, I was more gradual about applying pressure.  At this point,the pain in the sub-occipital area is now minimal while being massaged. I also learned to use VERY LIGHT pressure on my lower back, which is themost vulnerable point for meIt also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder bladesalthough, again, it took a few days of massaging (just a few minutes aa time) to really work it outI highly recommend this product if you have similar problems, although cannot vouch for its durability (it seems pretty sturdy), since I've hait such a short time.  I plan to use it not only to ease tension, but alsoto loosen the muscls BEFORE exercising (and maybe after, too).  I havbeen ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks, so thiswas very timely  for meThis is the 1st product I've ordered from this company and only recentlbecame aware of it thru a co-worker.  The catalog states they have beein business since 1976.  It contains quite a few health care products andwhile they appear to be more expensive than the average health care cataloproducts, they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thoughput into what they actually do.  Definitely a step above some other oneI\'ve seen such as "Dr. Leonards Health Care Catalog" or "Mature Wisdom"I'm only 37, but have ended up on some geriatric-type mailing lists (nbig surprise here :-) ).  I consider many of those products to be rip-offs,particularly targeted toward the elderly, with dubious health benefitsI apologize for the length of this, but it's the kind of info _I_ wouldlike to know before ordering something thru the mailRobin Coutellier                  Northern Telecom, Mountain MyView, CINTERNET: robin@ntmtv.coUUCP:portal!ntmtv!robi

I know that the placebo effect is where a patient feels better oreven gets better because of his/her belief in the medicine andthe doctor administering it.  Is there also an anti-placeboeffect where the patient dislikes/distrusts doctors and medicineand therefore doesn't get better or feel better in spite of themedicineIs there an effect where the doctor believes so strongly in amedicine that he/she sees improvement where the is none or seesmore improvement than there is?  If so, what is this effectcalled?  Is there a reverse of the above effect where the doctordoesn't believe in a medicine and then sees less improvement thanthere is?  What would this effect be called?  Have these effectsever been studied?  How common are these effects?  Thank you inadvance for all replies....

Just had the opportunity to watch this flick on A&E -- some 15 yearsince I saw it last. I was very interested in the technology demonstrated in this filfor handling infectious diseases (and similar toxic substances)Clearly they "faked" a lot of the computer & robotic technologycertainly at the time it was made most of that was science fictioitself, let alone the idea of a "space germ". Quite coincidentally [actually this is what got me wanted to sethe movie again] I watched a segment on the otherwise awful _How'They Do That?_ dealing with a disease researcher at the CDC's tolab.  There was description of the elaborate security measures takeso that building will never be "cracked" so to speak by man onature (short of deliberate bombing from the air, perhaps).  Anthe researchers used "spacesuits" similar to that in the filmI\'m curious what people think about this film -- short of "silly"Is such a facility technically feasible today?

But the analysiis quasi-public: the researcher describes it and presents the data owhich it is based so that others can verify it. It is worth noting that in biological studies where the subjects aranimals, such as mice, there were many cases of skewed results becausthose who performed the study did not "blind" themselves.

A bit more than a year ago, a hernia in my right groin wadiscovered.  It had produced a dull pain in that area.  The herniwas repaired using the least intrusive (orthoscopic?) method and "plug and patch"The doctor considered the procedure a successA few months later the same pain returned.  The doctor said thahe could find nothing wrong in the area of the hernia repairNow the pain occurs more often.  My GP couldn't identify anspecific problem.  The surgen who performed the original procedurnow says that yes there is a "new" hernia in the same area and hsaid that he has to cut into the area for the repair this timeMy question to the net:  Is there a nonintrusive method tdetermine if in fact there is a hernia or if the pain is frosomething elseSteve Heffne

-*---I think that part of the problem is that I have proposed definition of science that I intended to be interpreted broadland that Lee Lady has interpreted fairly narrowly.

Lee Lady writes> I don't think that science should be defined in a way that some> of the activities that lead to really important science --- namel> thinking and informal exploration --- are not recognized a> scientific work. Unless one classifies "thinking and informal exploration" as mistake, they fall under my definition.

It is noclear to me that the kind of definition I have proposed should btaken as describing what "science is mainly about."  Considerfor example, a definition of invertebrates as all animals lackina backbone.  This fairly tells what is an invertebrate anwhat is not an invertebrate, but it hardly tells you whainvertebrates are all about.  One can read this definition anstill not know that 95% of all animal species are invertebratesthat invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form, thasome invertebrate groups -- such as insects and nematodes -- arubiquitous in all ecosystems, etc.  In short, knowing thdefinition of invertebrates does *not* tell one what they ar"mainly about.The misunderstanding here is my fault.  I did not give sufficiencontext for people to understand my proposed definition> Okay, so let's see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees> of certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully> controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the> extent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain> treatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even> if uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement tha> a treatment is useful. ..> SECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of> evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal. I agree on both counts.  As an example of the second, it would onltake a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarianthat a treatment was effective, despite a lack of controls. As to the first, I do not think it is useful to talk abou"absolute scientific truth."  I think it is more useful to talabout the kinds of evidence that various claims have and thkinds of evidence IN PARTICULAR FIELDS that in the past havproven faulty or reliable.  The latter is obviously a matter odegree, and in each field, practitioners try to discover threlevance of different kinds of evidence. One of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea apsuedo-science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportioregarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claimthe kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it, and thhistorical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidencare given more weight than others.  It is perfectly alright tspeculate.  I have read quite a few refereed papers thaspeculated left and right.  But the authors were careful tidentify the notions as speculative, to list what little evidencwas presently available for them, and to describe how researccould proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or tuncover its problems.  Often what distinguishes whether a papeof this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which thauthor sets the context and paves the way for future work.  (Iis in this area that many proponents of speculative ideas fail.> The folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not t> make this simple test.

Wheproponents of some practice see no value in more carefuinvestigation of that practice, that sets alarms ringing in manresearchers' minds. This is unfortunate, because there is undoubtedly somintersection between things that are worth investigating anthings that are advocated by those who seem careless ounreasonable in their advocacy.

There is no question thaorally administered doses of MSG are capable of destroying nearly alneurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the mediaeminence.

It's unethical t"sacrifice" humans to check out what effects chronic, acute, etc doseof these compounds are having on the brain tissue in humans.  The fooindustry knows this. That's why the animal model is used in medicinand psych.  If you're talking about straight sensitivity, it would buseful to define the term.

Certainlthe doses for excitotoxicity in adults are considerably larger thafor the young, but the additivity of Glu and Asp, and their copiouand increased presence in modern processed foods (jointly), and theihidden presence in HVP, necessitates extreme caution.

While in grad school, I remember a biochemistry friend of mine working wit"heat shock proteins". Apparently, burning protein will induce changes in hDNA. Whether these changes survive the denaturing that occurs during digestioI don't know, but I never eat burnt food because of this.Also, many woods contain toxins. As they are burnt, it would seem logical thasome may volatilise, and get into the BBQed food. Again, I don't know if thestoxins (antifungal and anti-woodeater compounds) would survive the rather harsconditions of the stomach and intestine, and then would they be able to crosthe intestinal mucosaMaybe someone with more biochemical background than myself (which is almos*anyone*... :)) can shed some light on heat shock proteins and the toxins thamay be in the wood used to make charcoal and BBQAnne-Marie Rousseae-mail: rousseaua@immunex.coWhat I say has nothing to do with Immunex

As nobody in the food industry has even bothered to address my previouquestion "WHY DO YOU NEED TO PUT MSG IN ALMOST EVERY FOOD?" I must assumthat my wife's answer is closer to the truth than I hoped it wasShe believes that MSG is added to food to cause people to eat more of iand not quit when they shoud be sated.  To put it a different way, shebelieves that for some people MSG causes them to act toward food like an addict. (Eat all the chips, chow down on several packages of noodle soup .... you get thidea! }  IF she is right, then the moral and ethical standards of thefood, chemical and regulatory groups need to be addressed!!!  Can MSbe considered a conditioning substance (not addictive but sort of habiforming) This brings up a side question of mine.   I have noticed that cats (mchildren's and my parent's) seem to fixate on a particular brand of pefood. The cat will eat any product within one brand and not any othebrand.  I have wondered if this is not a case of preference, but, somsort of chemical training or addiction. My questions, for the net, areDoes the FDA regulate the contents of pet food?  Is it allowed for pefood to contain addictive or conditioning substances?

A not-overly critical but still useful overview of 3alternative health therapies.  ...the Russian engineer Semyon Kirlian and his wife Valentina during th  1950s.  Using alternating currents of high frequency to 'illuminate  their subjects, they photographed them.  They found that if an objec  was a good conductor (such as a metal) the picture showed only it  surface, while the pictures of poor conductors showed the inne  structure of the object even if it were optically opaque.  They foun  too that these high frequency pictures could distinguish between dea  and living objects.  Dead ones had a constant outline whilst living one  were subject to changes.  The object's life activity was also visible i  highly variable colour patterns  High frequency photography has now been practised for twenty years i  the Soviet Union but only a few people in the West have taken it u  seriously.  Professor Douglas Dean in New York and Professor Philips a  Washington University in St Louis have produced Kirlian photographs an  others have been produced in Brazil, Austria and Germany  Using Kirlian photography it is possible to show an aura around people'  fingers, notably around those of healers who are concentrating o  healing someone.  Normally, blue and white rays emanate from the finger  but, when a subject becomes angry or excited, the aura turns red an  spotty.  The Soviets are now using Kirlian photography to diagnos  diseases which cannot be diagnosed by any other method.  They argue tha  in most illnesses there is a preclinical stage during which the perso  isn't actually ill but is about to be.  They claim to be able t  foretell a disease by photographing its preclinical phase  But the most exciting phenomenon illustrated by Kirlian photography i  the phantom effect.  During high frequency photography of a leaf fro  which a part had been cut, the photograph gave a complete picture of th  leaf with the removed part showing up faintly.  This is extremel  important because it backs up the experiences of psychics who can 'see  the legs of amputees as if they were still there.  The important thin  about the Kirlian phantoms though is that the electromagnetic patter  can't possibly represent a secondary phenomenon -- or the field woul  vanish when the piece of leaf or leg vanished.  The energy gri  contained in a living object must therefore be far more significant tha  the actual object itself  [...

The crank usually works in isolation from everyone else in his field o  study, making grand discoveries in his basement.  Many paranorma  movements can be traced back to such people -- Kirlian photography, fo  instance.  If you pump high-voltage electricity into anything it wil  emit glowing sparks, common knowledge to electrical workers an  hobbyists for a century.  It took a lone basement crank to declare tha  the sparks represent some sort of spiritual aura.  In fact, Kirlia  photography was subjected to rigorous testing by physicists John O  Pehek, Harry J. Kyler, and David L. Faust, who reported their finding  in the October 15, 1976, issue of Science.  Their conclusion: Th  variations observed in Kirlian photographs are due solely to moisture o  the surface of the body and not to mysterious "auras" or eve  necessarily to changes in mood or mental state.  Nevertheless  television shows, magazines, and books (many by famou  parapsychologists) continue to promote Kirlian photography as proof o  the unknown--Peter Kaminskkaminski@netcom.co

We will be holding a bake and craft sale at Communiversity in Princeton on Nassau Street, Saturday April 24th 12-4 p.m. to benefit the Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis Foundation, a nonprofit foundation established to encourage research toward a cure for Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.  Our three year old daughter suffers from this disease.  Below is a press release that appeared in local newspapers.  Hope you can join usOn Saturday, April 24 as part of Communiversity in Princeton, a local family will be having a bake and craft sale to raise money for and create public awareness about a rare disease called Recurrent Respiratory PapillomatosisBill and Marlene Stern's daughter Lindsay is afflicted with this disease characterized by tumors attacking the inside of the larynx, vocal cords and trachea.  Caused by a virus, the tumors grow, block the air passages and would lead to death from suffocation without continual surgery to remove the growths.  Three year old Lindsay has undergone 11 operations thus far since her diagnosis last year and faces the prospect of over a hundred operations throughout her lifetime. Even though the disease is hardly a household word, it has affected the lives of enough people to inspire the formation of the Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis Foundation,  a non-profit foundation whose goals are to provide support for patients and families by networking patients and publishing a newsletter, enhance  awareness of RRP at the local and national level, and aid in the prevention, cure, and treatmentSince medical researchers know that the virus causing the disease is similar to those viruses causing warts, they feel a cure would be within reach if money were available for research.  Because RRP is rare, it not only gets scant attention but also paltry funds to search for a cure.  Part of the RRP Foundation's mission is to change that.Anyone interested in contributing items to the bake and craft sale, please call Marlene or Bill at 609-890-0502.  Monetary donations can be made at the Foundation's booth during Communiversity, April 24th, 12 to 4 p.m., in downtown Princeton, or sent directly to\t\t\tThe Recurrent Respiratory Foundatio\t                50 Wesleyan Driv\t                Hamilton Sq., NJ  08690Thanks   mstern@lindsay.princeton.ed

Unfortunately, too often the prize is limiteand the efficacy of the 'cure' questionable when applied to alsufferersThis applies to both medical researchers and non-medical individualsJust because it appears in an obscure journal and may be of some usdoes not make the next cure-all. What about the dozens of individualwho have courageously participated in clinical trials? Did they have anguarentee of cures? Are they any less because they didn't trumpet theistory all over the worldAs a parting note, wasn't there some studies done on Gingko seeds foMeniere's? (To the original poster : what about trying for a trial othat? It's probably not a final answer but it certainly may alleviatsome of the discomfort. And you'd be helping answer the question fofuture sufferers.gervai

It is not true that dermatologists gave not reached the laser age, ifact, lasers in dermatological surgery is a very new and exciting fieldIt probably won't be effective in tinea pedis because the laser iusually a superficial burn (to avoid any deeper damage). Limited tinepedis can be cured albeit sometimes slowly by topical antifungals awell as systemic medication i.e. tablets. Finally, a self-diagnosis inot always reliable, lichen simplex chronicus can look like a fungainfection and requires very different treatmentgervai

I've noticed that when go out and eat in most of the Chinese food restaurants, I will usually gea slight headache and an ununsual thirst afterwards.  This happens to manof my friends and relatives too.

>I recently heard of a mental disorder called Obsessive Compulsiv>Disorder.  What is it?  What causes it?  Could it be caused by >nervous breakdown>Obesssive Compulsive Disorder (not to be confused with Obsessive Compulsiv_Personality_ Disorder !) is an acute anxiety disorder characterized beither obsessions (persistent intrusive thoughts that cause anxiety whenot entertained), or compulsions (repetitive, ritualistic actions thasimilarly cause intense psychological discomfort when resisted). OCD is often associated with certain forms of depression. Examples of obsessive thoughts are repeated impulses to kill a loveone (though not accompanied by anger), or a religious person havingrecurrent blasphemous thoughts.  Generally, the individual attempts to ignoror suppress the intrusive thoughts by engaging in other activities. The individual realizes that the thoughts originate from the own mind, rathethan being from an external sourceExamples of compulsive actions are constant repetitive hand washingor other activity that is not realistically related to alleviating source of the anxietyIn OCD, the obsessions or compulsions are highly distressing to thindividual, take an hour or more per day, and significantly impair theidaily routine and social relationshipsTreatments include psychotherapy, behavioral methods, and sometimecertain anti-depressants which have recently been found effective in alleviatinobsessions and compulsionsThe standard diagnostic code for OCD, if you want to look it up in thDSM-III manual of psychiatric diagnosis is 300.30 \t\t\t\t\t\tkind regards\t\t\t\t\t\ttod+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------| Todd I.

\tThe reason I'm posting this article to this newsgroup is to1. gather any information about this disorder from anyone who migh   have recently been *e*ffected by it ( from being associated wit   it or actually having this disorder ) an2. help me find out where I can access any medical literature associate   with seizures over the internetRecently, I had a baby boy born with seizures which occured 12-15 hourafter birth. He was immediately transferred to a major hospital in Bostoand has since been undergoing extensive drug treatment for his conditionThis has been a major learning experience for me and my wife not only ilearning the medical problems that faced our son but also in dealing withospitals, procedures...etcI don't want to go into a lot of detail, but his condition was termedquite severe at first then slowly he began to grow and put on weighas a normal baby would. He was put on the standard anti-convulsion drugand that did not seem to help out. His MRI, EKG, cat-scans are all normalbut the EEG's show alot of seizure activity. After many metabolic testsbody structure tests, and infection/virus tests the doctors still do noknow quite what type of siezures he is having (although they do have aloof evidence that it is now pointing to infantile spasms ). This is wherwe stand right now...If anyone knows of any database or newsgroup or as I mentioned up aboveany information relating to this disorder I would sure appreciate hearinfrom you. I am not trying to play doctor here, but only trying to gatheinformation about it. As I know now, these particular types of disorderare still not really well understood by the medical community, and so I'going to see now....if somehow the internet can at least give me alittlinsight. Thanks.

Ther>is a book "The Yeast Connection" which talks about this "illness">There is no convincing evidence that such a disease existsThere's a lot of evidence, it just hasn't been adequately gathered anpublished in a way that will convince the die-hard melancholic skepticwho quiver everytime the word 'anecdote' or 'empirical' is usedFor example, Dr. Ivker, who wrote the book "Sinus Survival", always givesbefore any other treatment, a systemic anti-fungal (such as Nizoral) to hinew patients IF they've been on braod-spectrum anti-biotics 4 or more timein the last two years.  He's kept a record of the results, and for over2000 patients found that over 90% of his patients get significant relieof allergic/sinus symptoms.  Of course, this is only the beginning for hiprogramIn my case, as I reported a few weeks ago, I was developing the classisymptoms outlined in 'The Yeast Connection' (I agree it is a poorlywritten book):  e.g., extreme sensitivity to plastics, vapors, etc. whicI never had before (started in November).  Within one week of full dosagof Sporanox, the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared - I canow sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes.  I'm als*greatly* improved in other areas as wellOf course, I have allergy symptoms, etc.  I am especially allergic tmolds, yeasts, etc.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out thaif one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body, and you have natural allergy to yeasts, that a threshold would be reached where yowould have perceptible symptoms.  Also, yeast do produce toxins of variousorts, and again, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize thasuch toxins can cause problems in some people.  In my case it was sinusince that's the center of my allergic response.  Of course, the $60,00question is whether a person who is immune compromised (as tests showed I wafrom over 5 years of antibiotics, nutritionally-deficiencies because of thstress of infections and allergies, etc.), can develop excessive yeascolonization somewhere in the body.  It is a tough question to answer sinctesting for excessive yeast colonization is not easy.  One almost has ttake an empirical approach to diagnosis.  Fortunately, Sporanox is relativelsafe unlike past anti-fungals (still have to be careful, however) so there'no reason any longer to withhold Sporanox treatment for empirical reasonsBTW, some would say to try Nystatin.  Unfortunately, most yeast grows hyphatoo deep into tissue for Nystatin to have any permanent affect.  You'll fina lot of people who are on Nystatin all the timeIn summary, I appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keemedicine on the right road.  But methinks that some who hold too firmlto the party line are academics who haven't been in the trenches long enougactually treating patients.  If anybody, doctors included, said to me to mface that there is no evidence of the 'yeast connection', I cannot guarantetheir safety.

Researchers have found that eating a cup of yogurt a day drastically   reduces a woman's chances of getting vaginal candida, a yeast infection  For the year-long study, researchers at Long Island Jewish Medical   Center in New Hyde Park, New York, recruited 13 women who suffered fromchronic yeast infections. For the first 6 months, the women each day at8 ounces of yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus. For the second6 months, the women did not eat yogurt. The researchers examined the   women each month and found that incidents of colonization and infectionwere significantly lower during the period when the women ate yogurt.    The fungus Candida albicans can live in the body without doing harm. It is an overproliferation of the fungus that leads to infection. The  researchers concluded that the L. acidophilus bacteria found in some   brands of yogurt retard overgrowth of the fungus. Streptococcus        thermophilus and L. bulgaricus are the two bacteria most commonly used in commercial yogurt production. Neither one appears to exert a        protective effect against Candida albicans, however. Women who want to try yogurt as a preventive measure should choose a brand that lists    acidophilus in its contents.                                           --- end --                                          ==================================InfoTrac - Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '9  THE MATERIAL CONTAINED IN Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92 IS PROVIDE  ONLY FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED A  MEDICAL ADVICE OR INSTRUCTION.

I first heard about it in this newsgroupseveral years ago, and I have just got hold of a book, "How to improve yousight - simple daily drills in relaxation", by Margaret D. Corbett,('Authorized instructor of the Bates method), published in 1953.  Ittalks about vision improvement by relaxation and exercise.  Has there beeany study on whether this method actually works?  If it works, is it byactually shortening the previously elongated eyeball, or by increasingthe lens's ability to flatten itself in order to compensate for thetoo-long eyeballSince myopia is the result of eyeball elongation, seems to me the moslogical approach for correction is to find a way to reverse the processi.e., shorten it somehow (preferably non-surgically).  Has there beeany recent studies on this?  Where can I find them?  I know RK works bychanging the curvature of the cornea to compensate for the shape ofeyeball, but if there is a way to train the muscles to shorten theeyeball back to its correct length that would be even better (Bates'sidea, right?Thanks for any information

Can someone tell me whether or not any of the following medicationshas been linked to rapid/excessive weight gain and/or a distortedsense of taste or smell:  Hismanal; Azmacort (a topical steroid toprevent asthma); VancenaseAlsoYou may have guessed, I'm an allergy sufferer--but I'm beginning tosuspect I'm also the victim of a Dr. toliberal with the prescriptionp. The allergist I went to last Oct. simply inquired about my symptons( I was suffering chronic asthma attacks), gave me a battery ofallergy tests, and went down a checklist of drugs (a photocopiedsheet).  I've gained out 30 lbs. since then though I haven't eatenmore or much differently than before; I'vsuffered depression; ,fatigue; and I've experienced a foul smell and sense of taste forabout the last two months.  I mentioned the lack of smell and taste tothis Dr. in Feb. and he said my sinuses did look a bit swollen (hejust looked up my nose with his little light--the same one used forears), and prescribed Prednisone and Sulfatrim DS (severe headachesand a rash resulted, particularly after my week's worth of Prednisoneran out).  Now he wants to do a rhinoscopy to see if I have a bleedingulcer or polyps in my sinus cavities.  I'm considering seeing anotherdoctor.  Any suggestions/advice?  I'd really appreciate it

I have become involved in a project to further develop andimprove the performance of SPECT (Single Photon EmissioComputerized Tomography) imaging.  We will eventually havto peddle this stuff somewhere, and so as I move this thinalong, I would like to know -What is the current resolution of SPECT imaging?  What kindof jobs is SPECT used for, specifically?  What kind of specific jobcould I hopthat SPECT could be used for, if its resolution improvedsay, to close to that of PET (Positron Emission Tomography)And how much does a SPECT machine cost?  How much does a singlSPECT image cost? If anyone knows the answer to any or all of these questions, Owhere I could find that answer, I would be very grateful, indeed.

I recently learned about these devices that supposedly induce specificbrain wave frequencies in their users simply by wearing them. Mind machineconsist of LED gogles, head phones, and a microprocessor that controls themThey strobe the (closed) eye and send sound pulses in sync with the flashinLEDs. I understand that these devices are experimental, but they are availableI've heard claims that they can induce sleep, and light trance states forelaxation. Essentially they are supposed to work without aid of drugs etc..I would think that if they work as reported they would be incredibly usefulThe few sources I've seen are biased (they are selling the things, and friend who has tried them claims that "every home should have one"). Sodo these mind machines (aka Light and Sound machines) work? can they inducalpha, theta, and/or delta waves in a person wearing them? What research iany has been done on them? Could they be used in lieu of a tranquilizerOr are they just another bit of quackeryWeb Homehomer@tripos.co

I've recently listened to a tape by Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski, in which heclaims to have discovered a series naturally occuring peptides with anticancer properties that he names antineoplastons.  Burzynski says that hiswork has met with hostility in the United States, despite the favorableresponses of his subjects during clinical trialsWhat is the generally accepted opinion of Dr. Burzynski's research?  Hepaints himself as a lone researcher with a new breakthrough battling anintolerant medical establishment, but I have no basis from which to judgehis claims.  Two weeks ago, however, I read that the NIH's Department ofAlternative Medicine has decided to focus their attention on Burzynski'swork.  Their budget is so small that I imagine they wouldn't investigate atreatment that didn't seem promisingAny opinions on Burzynski's antineoplastons or information about the currentstatus of his research would be appreciated-Joshua Schwimmejschwimmer@eagle.wesleyan.ed

 I am not sure if this is the proper group to post this to but here goes anyway About five years ago my mother was diagnosed with having cancer in the lymph node under one of her arms. After the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movemen of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it. Over the course o the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produce the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain. At this time her doctor suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue While attending one of her therapy sessions, while her arm was being manipulated, some damage occured (nerve?) which caused the level of pain to permanentl increase severly (controlled by Tylenol 3s) and some loss of use of the arm  palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement). With great persistence on her par the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer ha been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm. This was removed also but th pain in the arm has not decreased. The doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed Tylenol  and soon Morphine to relieve the pain. She has tried acupuncture by this only provide minor reductions in pain and is only short term.  My questions are:     Has anyone has heard of similar cases and what, if anything, was done to reduce th     levels of pain     Are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced     Are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored  Any general suggestions on pain reduction would be greatly appreciated    Please respond by email because I do not always get chance to read this group  If anyone knows of some literature that may be useful to this case or another newsgrou  that I should be posting this to it would also be appreciated      --Gregory W.

I experienced a sudden numbness in my left arm this morning.  Just afteI completed my 4th set of deep squats.  Today was my weight traininday and I was just beginning my routine.  All of a sudden at the end othe 4th set my arm felt like it had gone to sleep.  It was cold, turned paleand lost 60% of its strength.  The weight I used for squats wasn't thaheavy, I was working hard but not at 100% effort.  I waited for a fewminutes, trying to shake the arm back to life and then continued witchest exercises (flyes) with lighter dumbells than I normally use.  BuI dropped the left dumbell during the first set, and experienced continuearm weakness into the second.  So I quit training and decided not to do musual hour on the ski machine either.  I'll take it easy for the rest othe dayMy arm is *still* somewhat numb and significantly weaker than normal -my hand still tingles a bit down to the thumb. Color has returned to normaand it is no longer cold.Horrid thoughts of chunks of plaque blocking a major artery course througmy brain.  I'm 34, vegetarian, and pretty fit from my daily exercisregimen.  So that can't be it.

Am I justified in being pissed off at this doctorLast Saturday evening my 6 year old son cut his finger badly with a knifeI took him to a local "Urgent and General Care" clinic at 5:50 pm.  Theclinic was open till 6:00 pm.  The receptionist went to the back and told thedoctor that we were there, and came back and told us the doctor would notsee us because she had someplace to go at 6:00 and did not want to be delayedhere.  During the next few minutes, in response to my questions, with severaltrips to the back room, the receptionist told me\t- the doctor was doing paperwork in the back\t- the doctor would not even look at his finger to advise us on goin\t  to the emergency room\t- the doctor would not even speak to me\t- she would not tell me the doctor's name, or her own name\t- when asked who is in charge of the clinic, she said "I don\'t know.I realize that a private clinic is not the same as an emergency room, buI was quite angry at being turned away because the doctor did not want tbe bothered.  My son did get three stitches at the emergency room.  I'm stilltrying to find out who is in charge of that clinic so I can write them aletter.

They     do this because you are not the only one concerned about transmission ofdiseases via this route...so it\'s good business to advertise "disposable needlesused here." These needles tend to be of a lower quality however,being poorly manufactured and too "sharp" in my opinion. They tend to snag bloodvessels on insertion compared to higher quality needles.                                                                       If I choose to use acupuncture for a given complaint, that patient will gettheir own set of new needles which are sterilized between treatments.     The risk here for hepatitis, HIV, etc. transmission is that I could mistakenlyuse an infected persons needles accidently on the wrong             patient...but clear labelling and paying attention all but eliminatesthis risk. Better quality needles tend to "slide" past vessels and           nerves avoiding unpleasant painful snags..and hematomas...so I use them.                       Acupuncture needles come in many lengths and thicknesses...but they are allsolid when compared to their injection-style cousins. In China, herbal solutionsand western pharmaceuticals are occasionally injected intomeridian points purported to have TCM physiologic effects and so requirethe same hollow needles used for injecting fluid medicine. This means...thinkingtiny...that a samll amount of tissue, the diameter of the needle bore, will beinjected into the body as it would  be in a typical "shot." when the skin ispuntured. On the other hand when the solidacupuncture needle is inserted, the skin tends to "squeeze" the needlefrom the tip to the level of insertion such that any 'cooties' thathaven't been schmeared away with alcohol before insertion, tend to remainon the surface of the skin minimizing invasion from the exterior.Of course in TCM...the body's exterior is protected by the Wei (Protective) Qi..so infection is unlikely....or in other words...there is a normal inflammatoryand immune response that accompanies tissue damage incurred at the puncturesiteWhile I'm fairly certain your friend will not have a transferable diseasetransmitted to them via acupuncture needle insertion, I would like to know forwhat complaint they have consulted the acupuncturist...not to know  if it would be harmful.. but to know if it would be helpful.John Badanes, DC, Cromdas@uclink.berkeley.ed

For several years I have been dealing with reccurring corneal  erosion.    Therdoes  not  seem  to be much known about the cause of such a problem.  My currenepisode is pretty bad since it is located in the middle of the cornea.  If  it'bad  enough, the usual treatment for it is puncture therapy.  However, my doctothis time is trying to let it heal by  itself  by  putting  a  contact  lens  tprotect the area.  Apparently the problem is not that common, but I'd be curiouif anyone else out there has a similar problem, perhaps to see if a cause can bfound.Mark LondoMRL@NERUS.PFC.MIT.ED

Skiwas flushed, sweating, vomiting and had severe headache pain.  It subsidein an hour or so.  Since then, she has been taking Imitrex as needed tcontrol the pain.  Immediately after taking it, she has increased head paifor ten minutes, dizziness and mild nausea and mild chest pains.

In comparison, inthe United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overalldecreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase ingonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence ofthis disease from 1985 through 1992.     In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Departmentof Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992,reported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively(Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics(15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported caseswith race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7%of all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases byage groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than orequal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of allreported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for thelargest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest agegroup-specific rate (639 per 100,000).     Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denvermetropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in thestate (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan areaoccurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoodsconsidered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/acquired immunodeficiencysyndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity.     When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed amongmen in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic inthe Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visitsby males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently, the number of casesdiagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men,the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed amongself-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992,respectively).     Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO,university hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contactedto determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrheaculture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in thefourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning).     From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites andHispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacksHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 1Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199increased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992, the population in Coloradoincreased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. In 1992,the gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that forwhites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000)(Table 1). Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, casesincreased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups.Reported by: KA Gershman, MD, JM Finn, NE Spencer, MSPH, STD/AIDS Program; REHoffman, MD, State Epidemiologist, Colorado Dept of Health.

Surveillance and Information Systems Br,Div of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and HIV Prevention, National Center forPrevention Svcs, CDC.Editorial Note: The increase in reported gonorrhea cases in Colorado in 1992may represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or morecomplete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDHsurveillance staff during 1991-1992. The increases in confirmed gonorrheacases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratoriessuggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact.However, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planninglaboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that thegonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population.     One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea inColorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in arecent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs(2). Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan areacoincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requiresfurther assessment. To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicatedpreviously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6)-- the CDH STD/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whomgonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs,and gang affiliation.     The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds thenational health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective19.1a) (7). Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor forgonorrhea and other STDs. Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups atgreatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts. Moreover, racespecific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such associoeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors.     In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado,interventions initiated by the CDH STD/AIDS program include 1) targetingpartner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups atincreased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old blackmales); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radioHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 1Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199announcements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters inschools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targetedprimarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators toperform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. The educationalinterventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance ofmembers of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leadersand health-care providers.Reference1.

Child safety seats and safetybelts can substantially reduce this loss (2). From 1977 through 1985, all 50states passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safetybelts for children. Although these laws reduce injuries to young children byan estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a majorcause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use ofoccupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage forthose aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). Inaddition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely touse restraints for their children (6). To characterize the association betweenadult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraintsfor the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDCanalyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System(BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989. This report summarizes the findings from thisstudy.     Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based,random-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard InjuryControl and Child Safety Module developed by CDC. Of these respondents, 5499(26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. Each respondentwas asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use forthat child. The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use inthis analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less thanconsistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up).Data were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. Softwarefor Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimatesand confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences were definedby p values of less than 0.05.     Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. Of these, six(Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had nolaw requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania,and Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., avehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuseof safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primaryenforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for asafety-belt law violation alone). In nine states, child-passenger protectionHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 1Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199laws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two statesused both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use.The analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a lawrequiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law(no-law states).     Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were notconsistently restrained during automobile travel. Both child restraint use andadult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-squaretest) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus43.2%, respectively).     High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1year were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less thanconsistent safety-belt use (Figure 1). Adults with consistent use reportedhigh rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age(range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). In comparison, foradults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of childoccupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1%for 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). When comparing children ofconsistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adultsafety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest agegroups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year).     Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceededthat in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1). In addition,higher adult educational attainment was significantly associated withincreased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associatedwith increased adult safety-belt use (8).Reported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; NationalCenter for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC.Editorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with othersindicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likelyto employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). Because thesenonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibitother risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greaterrisk for motor-vehicle injury (10).     Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated withchild restraint use in this report. Accordingly, occupant-protection programsshould be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. Because loweducational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, suchprograms should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that servelow-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that aredirected at parents with young children.     Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. Inaddition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants asHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 1Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199they become older. Parents, especially those with low educational attainment,those who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that donot have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safetybelts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats andsafety belts. Finally, the increased use of restraints among children mayincrease their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers --the age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and thehighest rate of fatal crashes (5).Reference1.

Reporting Period Covered: This report covers birth defects surveillancein metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, and selected jurisdictions in California forthe years 1983-1988.     Description of System: The California Birth Defects Monitoring Programand the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program are two populationbased surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods. Theprevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 19831988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitanAtlanta. The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race,sex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression.     Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetalalcohol syndrome, hip dislocation/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of thekidney/ureter, and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to generaldiagnostic variability. However, differences in the prevalences of arm/handlimb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) areprobably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because thesedefects are relatively easy to diagnose.     Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancytermination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. However,the reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown, but may berelated to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the genepool, or random variation.     Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases, severalcollaborative studies are being implemented. In particular, the differences inthe birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention onthe impact of prenatal diagnosis.

INFLUENZA -- UNITED STATES, 1988-8     Problem/Condition: CDC monitors the emergence and spread of new influenzavirus variants and the impact of influenza on morbidity and mortality annuallyfrom October through May.     Reporting Period Covered: This report covers U.S. influenza surveillanceconducted from October 1988 through May 1989.     Description of System: Weekly reports from the vital statistics officesof 121 cities provided an index of influenza's impact on mortality; 58 WHOcollaborating laboratories reported weekly identification of influenzaviruses; weekly morbidity reports were received both from the state andterritorial epidemiologists and from 153 sentinel family practice physicians.Nonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were receivedthroughout the year.     Results: During the 1988-89 influenza season, influenza A(H1N1) and Bviruses were identified in the United States with essentially equal frequencyoverall, although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shiftedover the course of the season. Throughout the season increases in the indicesof influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated weresimilar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated. Only 7% ofidentified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtypeincreased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the1989-90 season. During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes werereported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenzaA(H1N1).     Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance ofinfluenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes theimportance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, sinceamantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A.     Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data producedthroughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to makeinformed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine. CDC's annualsurveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidatesfor inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons.Authors: Louisa E.

Copyright 1993, The University of Arizon                 High Tech Assisted Reproductive TechnologieFollowing the birth of the first in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVFET) baby in 1978, a host of assisted reproductive technologies have beendeveloped that include IVF-ET, gamete intrafallopian tube transfer (GIFT),embryo cryopreservation (freezing) and gamete micromanipulation. Together,these technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductivetechnology (ART) procedures.Ovulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/orpathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertilitymanagement. However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate toproceed with one of the ART procedures.Therefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertilityservice at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology andInfertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes inART procedures. This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patientsin the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by thetraditional therapies.The following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in ourCenter, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers therealistic expectations for their success. Procedures included are:o in vitroo fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube  transfero (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation.This article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directedtowards improved success of these technologies.HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 2Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199                           Future Areas of ResearcIn addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward themanagement of infertile couples, we are developing the technology to assistcouples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditarydisease.This technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and thensubjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNAamplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization.There are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification byother centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis andhemophilia. We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situhybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification ofwhich will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibitsex-linked disorders.The considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact thatit circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibilityof a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birthof affected children.Catherine Racowsky, Ph.DAssociate Professor and Director of ResearcDepartment of Obstetrics and GynecologCollege of MedicineUniversity of ArizonTucson, Arizon               Applications, Success Rates and Advances for th                           Management of InfertilitThe following are the ART procedures available at The University of ArizonaCenter for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility.     In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of ourAssisted Reproduction Program.  This procedure involves retrieval ofunfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, andthe culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferredto the patient's uterus. All cultures are maintained in an incubator understrictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. Before beingprocessed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in ourandrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computerHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 2Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199assisted semen analyses. To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which toperform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typicallystimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasinghormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and/or GnRH analogues (lupron, Depolupron, synarel). Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggsobtained in non-stimulated cycles. While some programs utilize laparoscopicegg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia,we undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in ourInfertility Unit, with the patient sedated.      Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubaldeficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and/or mild forms of malefactor infertility.  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overallsuccess rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent percycle. Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173IVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate.     Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure isdisconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiologicalfactors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.  Wellrecognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenousovarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycleattempts. However, among these, age is the single most significant determinantof conception. Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to anAssisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure oftraditional therapies.     The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has notbeen clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggsavailable for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization ratessignificantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years;and 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age isunrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in ourCenter, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that maybe impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs thatfail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significantproportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently,the only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Ourprogram has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needsof a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy.     GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room,usually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involvesintroducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopiantube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). Under these circumstances, fertilizationoccurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF,with subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing fortransfer in a subsequent cycle. This ART procedure is applied to cases inHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 2Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199which there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has suchpathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertilityand/or idiopathic infertility.        The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990indicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtainedwith the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36percent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent). In view of this fact, one mightexpect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However, in ourprogram we have taken into account three basic concerns which, whilesubstantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit thepatient. These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performinga procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoinggeneral anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued fromobtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs,and the developmental competency of resultant embryos.     The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificialenvironment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. BetweenJanuary 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFTcycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent.     Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program whenembryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos.This procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity forsuccess at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethicalissues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore, as stipulatedby the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, fromboth a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programsshould have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys.     Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new,is applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen butwho have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml incombination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10percent sperm with normal morphology). We are currently developing theprocedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm underthe coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the spermthrough enzymatic digestion.     Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10percent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedlyrelates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm.Therefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniquesfor the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. Suchefforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technologyoffers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients toestablish conception.Catherine Racowsky, Ph.DHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 2Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199Associate Professor and Director of ResearcDepartment of Obstetrics and GynecologCollege of Medicine--------- end of part 2 -------------      Internet: david@stat.com                  FAX: +1 (602) 451-116      Bitnet: ATW1H@ASUACAD                     FidoNet=> 1:114/1                Amateur Packet ax25: wb7tpy@wb7tpy.az.usa.n

Anthony Fauci, director of theU.S.  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),  said,"We must address the question of how to treat people as  early as we possiblycan with drugs that are safe enough to give  people for years and that willget around microbial resistance."  He said any delay would signify questionsover safety and  resistance rather than a lack of funds.  Fauci, who coauthored  one of the two papers published last week in Nature, rejects the argument by one of his co-authors, Cecil Fox, that the new  discoveryindicates that "$1 billion spent on vaccine trials" has been "a waste of timeand money" because the trials were started  too long after the patients wereinfected and were ended too  quickly.  John Tew of the Medical College ofVirginia in Richmond claims that the new evidence strongly backs the argumentfor  early treatment of HIV-infected patients.  AIDS activists  welcomed thenew information but said the scientific community  has been slow to understandthe significance of infection of the  lymph tissue.

The OAM is a small division ofthe NIH, with its budget only at $2  million dollars compared to more than $10billion for the NIH as  a whole.  In addition, the money for availableresearch grants is even smaller.  About $500,000 to $600,000 total will beavailable this year for 10 or 20 grants.  Kaiya Montaocean, of the Center  forNatural and Traditional Medicine in Washington, D.C., says  the OAM is afraidto become involved in AIDS.  "They have to look successful and there is noeasy answer in AIDS," she said.    There is also a common perception that theOAM will focus on  fields the NIH establishment will find non-threatening,such as  relaxation techniques and acupuncture.  When the OAM called for  anadvisory committee conference of about 120 people last year,  the AIDScommunity was largely missing from the meeting.  In  addition, activists'general lack of contact with the Office has  added suspicion that the epidemicwill be ignored.  Jon  Greenberg, of ACT-UP/New York, said, "The OAM advisorypanel is  composed of practitioners without real research experience.  It will take them several years to accept the nature of research."  Nevertheless,  Dr. Leanna Standish, research director and AIDS  investigatorat the Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine in  Seattle, said, "Here is awonderful opportunity to fund AIDS  research.

Scientists conducting test tube experiments have found that  herpesvirus6 can attack the human immune system's natural killer cells.  This attackcauses the killer cells to malfunction,  diminishing an important component inthe immune system's fight  against diseases.  Also, the herpesvirus-6 may be afactor in  immune diseases, such as AIDS.  In 1989, Paolo Lusso's research found that herpesvirus-6 attacks another white cell, the CD4  T-lymphocyte,which is the primary target of HIV.  Lusso also  found that herpesvirus-6 canHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 4Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199kill natural killer cells.   Scientists previously knew that the naturalkiller cells of  patients infected with HIV do not work correctly.  Lusso's research represents the first time scientists have indicated that naturalkiller cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack,  according to AnthonyL. Komaroff, a researcher with Harvard  Medical School.  Despite the test-tubefindings, scientists are  uncertain whether the same result occurs in thebody.  Lusso's  team also found that herpesvirus-6 produces the CD4 receptor molecule that provides access for HIV.  CD4 T-lymphocytes express this surfacereceptor, making them vulnerable to HIV's attack.   Researchers concluded thatherpesvirus-6 cells can exacerbate the affects of HIV.    ======================================================================                                  April 15, 1993     ====================================================================  "AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: To the Editor" Journal of theAmerican Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Gellert,George and Nordenberg, Dale F.)     All health-care workers are obligated and responsible for not  onlyensuring that politicians understand the dimensions of  certain healthproblems, but also to be committed to related  policies, write George Gellertand Dale F. Nordenberg of the  Orange County Health Care Agency, Santa Ana,Calif., and the  Emory University School of Public Health in Atlanta, Ga., respectively.  Dr. Berkley's editorial on why American doctors  should careabout the AIDS epidemic beyond the United States  details several reasons forthe concerted interest that all  countries share in combating AIDS.  It shouldbe noted that while AIDS leads in hastening global health interdependence, itis not  the only illness doing so.  Diseases such as malaria and many respiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economicdevelopment of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations. Berkley mentions the enormous social and  economic impact that AIDS will haveon many developing countries, and the increased need for internationalassistance that will  result.  Berkley also cites the lack of politicalaggressiveness  toward the AIDS epidemic in its first decade.  But now thereis a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in  approachto international health and development in general, and  HIV/AIDS inparticular.  Vice President Al Gore proposes in his  book "Earth in theBalance" a major environmental initiative that includes sustainableinternational development, with programs to  promote literacy, improve childsurvival, and disseminate  contraceptive technology and access throughout thedeveloping  world.  If enacted, this change in policy could drastically change the future of worldwide health.====================================================================  "AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: In Reply" Journal of the AmericanHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 4Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Berkley, Seth)     Every nation should tackle HIV as early and aggressively as    possiblebefore the disease reaches an endemic state, even at a  cost of diverting lessattention to some other illnesses, writes  Seth Berkley of the RockefellerFoundation in New York, N.Y., in  reply to a letter by Drs. Gellert andNordenberg.  Although it is true that diseases other than AIDS, such asmalaria and  respiratory and intestinal illnesses, have similarly inhibited economic development in developing countries and deserve much  more attentionthan they are getting, Berkley disagrees with the  contention that AIDS isreceiving too much attention.  HIV  differs from other diseases, in mostdeveloping countries because it is continuing to spread.  For most endemicdiseases, the  outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is anotheryear  of about the same level of needless disease and death.  But with  AIDSand its increasing spread, the cost of neglect, not only in  disease burdenbut financially, is much greater.  Interventions  in the early part of arampantly spreading epidemic like HIV are  highly cost-effective because eachindividual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission.  Berkleysays he agrees  with Gellert and Nordenberg about the gigantic social and economic effects of AIDS and about the need for political  leadership.

Volunteers must be HIVinfected but have no symptoms of HIV disease.HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala said this initial study can be seen as "ahopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of HIV-infectedchildren who now face the certainty they will develop AIDS."Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy andInfectious Diseases and of the NIH Office of AIDS Research, said the trial "isthe first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delaydisease progression in children with HIV who are not yet sick."  If thesevaccines prove to be safe, more sophisticated questions about theirtherapeutic potential will be assessed in Phase II trials.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 10,000 children inthe United States have HIV.  By the end of the decade, the World HealthOrganization projects 10 million children will be infected worldwide.The study will enroll children ages 1 month to 12 years old.  NIAID, whichfunds the AIDS Clinical Trials Group network, anticipates conducting the trialat nine ACTG sites around  the country and three sites participating in theACTG but funded by the National Institute of Child Health and HumanDevelopment.Preliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults showsthat certain vaccines can boost existing HIV-specific immune responses andHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 4Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199stimulate new ones.  It will be several years, however, before researchersknow how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease.The results from the pediatric trial, known as ACTG 218, will be examinedclosely for other reasons as well.  "This trial will provide the first insightinto how the immature immune system responds to candidate HIV vaccines," saidDaniel Hoth, M.D., director of NIAID\'s division of AIDS.  "We need thisinformation to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can preventHIV infection in children."In the United States, most HIV-infected children live in poor inner-cityareas, and more than 80 percent are minorities, mainly black or Hispanic.Nearly all HIV-infected children acquire the virus from their mothers duringpregnancy  or at birth.  An infected mother in the United States has more thana one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby.  As growingnumbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to HIV through injectiondrug use or infected sexual partners, researchers expect a correspondingincrease in the numbers of infected children.HIV disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults. The most recent information suggests that 50 percent of infants born with HIVdevelop a serious AIDS-related infection by 3 to 6 years of age.  Theseinfections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses ofchildhood that can result in seizures, pneumonia, diarrhea and other symptomsleading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays.At least half of the children in the trial will be 2 years of age or youngerto enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and olderparticipants.  All volunteers must have well-documented HIV infection but nosymptoms of HIV disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollenliver or spleen.  They cannot have received any anti-retroviral or immuneregulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the study.Study chair John S. Lambert, M.D., of the University of Rochester MedicalSchool, and co- chair Samuel Katz, M.D., of Duke University School ofMedicine, will coordinate the trial assisted by James McNamara, M.D., medicalofficer in the pediatric medicine branch of NIAID's division of AIDS."We will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the childrenfor any side effects, to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms orfevers, for example, than another," said Dr. McNamara.  "We\'ll also look atwhether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or othersignificant laboratory or clinical effects."

These so-called subunit vaccines, each geneticallyengineered to contain only a piece of the virus, have so far proved welltolerated in ongoing trials in HIV-infected adults.One vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of Meriden, Conn., contains gp160--aprotein  that gives rise to HIV's surface proteins--plus alum adjuvant. Adjuvants boost specific immune responses to a vaccine.  Presently, alum isthe only adjuvant used in human vaccines licensed by the Food and DrugAdministration.Both of the other vaccines--one made by Genentech Inc. of South San Franciscoand the other by Biocine, a joint venture of Chiron and CIBA-Geigy, inEmeryville, Calif.--contain the major HIV surface protein, gp120, plusadjuvant.  The Genentech vaccine contains alum, while the Biocine vaccinecontains MF59, an experimental adjuvant that has proved safe and effective inother Phase I vaccine trials in adults.A low dose of each product will be tested first against a placebo in 15children.  Twelve children will be assigned at random to be immunized with theexperimental vaccine, and three children will be given adjuvant alone,considered the placebo.  Neither the health care workers nor the children willbe told what they receive.If the low dose is well-tolerated, controlled testing of a higher dose of theexperimental vaccine and adjuvant placebo in another group of 15 children willbegin.Each child will receive six immunizations--one every four weeks for sixmonths--and be followed-up for 24 weeks after the last immunization.

Although theHIV genes were active in the mice, they did not compromise the animals'immunity, the researchers found.  This led them to conclude that the HIVitself caused the skin disease.Our findings support a growing body of evidence that HIV can cause diseasewithout affecting the immune system, said lead author Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of theNational Institute of Dental Research (NIDR).  Dr. Kopp and his colleaguesdescribed their study in the March issue of AIDS Research and HumanRetroviruses.Developing animal models of HIV infection has been difficult, since mostanimals, including mice, cannot be infected by the virus.  To bypass thisproblem, scientists have developed HIV-transgenic mice, which carry genes forHIV as well as their own genetic material.NIDR scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting HIV genes into mouseeggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice.  The resulting litterscontained both normal and transgenic animals.Institute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of HIVgenetic material in l988.  Those mice, however, became sick and died too soonafter birth to study in depth.  In the present study, the scientists used anincomplete copy of HIV, which allowed the animals to live longer.Some of the transgenic animals developed scaling, wart-like tumors on theirnecks and backs.  Other transgenic mice developed thickened, crusting skinlesions that covered most of their bodies, resembling psoriasis in humans.  Noskin lesions developed in their normal, non-transgenic littermates.Studies of tissue taken from the wart-like skin tumors showed that they were atype of noncancerous tumor called papilloma. Although the papillomavirus cancause these skin lesions, laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in theanimals.Tissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed thepresence of a protein-producing molecule made by the HIV genetic material.

The fact that HIV genes were active but the animals' immunesystems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing theskin lesions, Dr. Kopp said.Further proof of HIV gene involvement came from a test in which the scientistsexposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light.  The light increased HIVgenetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin. Papilloma formation in response to increased HIV genetic activity proved thegenes were responsible for the skin condition, the scientists said.  Nolesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the UV light.The transgenic mice used in this study were developed at NIDR by Dr. PeterDickie, who is now with the National Institute of Allergy and InfectiousDiseases.Collaborating on the study with Dr. Kopp were Mr. Charles Wohlenberg, Drs.Nickolas Dorfman, Joseph Bryant, Abner Notkins, and Paul Klotman, all of NIDR;Dr. Stephen Katz of the National Cancer Institute; and Dr. James Rooney,formerly with NIDR and now with Burroughs WellcomeHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 5Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199               Clinical Consultation Telephone Service for AID                                H H S   N E W                  *******************************************                 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE                                 March 4, 199     HHS Secretary Donna E.

The toll-free National HIV Telephone Consulting Service is staffed by aphysician, a nurse practitioner and a pharmacist. It provides information ondrugs, clinical trials and the latest treatment methods.  The service isfunded by the Health Resources and Services Administration and operates out ofSan Francisco General Hospital.     Secretary Shalala said, "One goal of this project is to share expertiseso patients get the best care.  A second goal is to get more primary healthcare providers involved in care for people with HIV or AIDS, which reducestreatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers andcommunity social support networks.  Currently, many providers refer patientswith HIV or AIDS to specialists or other providers who have more experience."     Secretary Shalala said, "This clinical expertise should be especiallyhelpful for physicians and providers who treat people with HIV or AIDS incommunities and clinical sites where HIV expertise is not readily available."     The telephone number for health care professionals is 1-800-933-3413, andit is accessible from 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. EST (7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST)Monday through Friday.  During these times, consultants will try to answerquestions immediately, or within an hour.  At other times, physicians andhealth care providers can leave an electronic message, and questions will beanswered as quickly as possible.     Health care professionals may call the service to ask any questionrelated to providing HIV care, including the latest HIV/AIDS drug treatmentinformation, clinical trials information, subspecialty case referral,literature searches and other information.  The service is designed for healthcare professionals rather than patients, families or others who have alternatesources of information or materials.     When a health care professional calls the new service, the call is takenby either a clinical pharmacist, primary care physician or family nursepractitioner.  All staff members have extensive experience in outpatient andinpatient primary care for people with HIV-related diseases.  The consultantasks for patient-specific information, including CD4 cell count, currentmedications, sex, age and the patient's HIV history.     This national service has grown out of a 16-month local effort thatHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 5Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199responded to nearly 1,000 calls from health care providers in northernCalifornia.  The initial project was funded by HRSA's Bureau of HealthProfessions, through its Community Provider AIDS Training (CPAT) project, andby the American Academy of Family Physicians.     "When providers expand their knowledge, they also improve the quality ofcare they are able to provide to their patients," said HRSA AdministratorRobert G. Harmon. M.D., M.P.H.  "This project will be a great resource forhealth care professionals and the HIV/AIDS patients they serve."     "This service has opened a new means of communication between health careprofessionals and experts on HIV care management," said HRSA\'s associateadministrator for AIDS and director of the Bureau of Health ResourcesDevelopment, G. Stephen Bowen, M.D., M.P.H.  "Providers who treat people withHIV or AIDS have access to the latest information on new drugs, treatmentmethods and therapies for people with HIV or AIDS."

Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems. It runs under Windows 3.1 and supports that Accufont Technology of the HewlettPackard Scanners. When initially bringing up the software, it lets you select several options;(1) text / graphics (2) input source ie scanner, fax file, disk file (3)automatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image.I like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select whichparts of the document I would like scanned, and in what orderOnce an image is scanned, you can bring up the Pop-Up image verification.  Thesoftware gives you two "errors" at this point.  Blue which are words that wereconverted reliability, but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary. Yellow shade, which are words that Wordscan Plus doesn't think it convertedcorrectly at all.  I have found that the software should give itself morecredit.  It is usually correct, instead of wrong.  If a word is shaded blue,you can add it to your personal dictionary.  The only problem is the personaldictionary will only handle about 200 words.  I find this to be very limited,considering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary.After a document is converted, you can save it in a multitude of wordprocessor formats.

Since the early 1970s, the U.S. public health system hasbeen challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g.,Escherichia coli O157:H7, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus,Legionnaires disease, Lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome). The incidencesof many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera,malaria, and tuberculosis (TB), have increased in many areas. Furthermore,control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drugresistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease,salmonellosis, shigellosis, TB, and staphylococcal infections (2). Emerginginfections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, thosein institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), andminority and underserved populations. The substantial economic burden ofemerging infections on the U.S. health-care system could be reduced by moreeffective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs(3).     This issue of MMWR introduces a new series, "Emerging InfectiousDiseases." Future articles will address these diseases, as well assurveillance, control, and prevention efforts by health-care providers andpublic health officials. This first article updates the ongoing investigationof an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in the western United States (4).Reference1. Burnet M. Natural history of infectious disease.

Washington     On January 13, 1993, a physician reported to the Washington Department ofHealth a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and anincrease in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea. During January 16-17, acase-control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea orpostdiarrheal HUS identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controlsimplicated eating at chain A restaurants during the week before symptom onset(matched odds ratio OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5). On January18, a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain A restaurantswas initiated.     As a result of publicity and case-finding efforts, during JanuaryFebruary 1993, 602 patients with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to thestate health department. A total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the casedefinition of culture-confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection or postdiarrheal HUS(Figure 1). Of the 477 persons, 52 (11%) had close contact with a person withconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection during the week preceding onset ofsymptoms. Of the remaining 425 persons, 372 (88%) reported eating in a chain Arestaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms. Of the 338 patientswho recalled what they ate in a chain A restaurant, 312 (92%) reported eatinga regular-sized hamburger patty. Onsets of illness peaked from January 17through January 20. Of the 477 casepatients, 144 (30%) were hospitalized; 30developed HUS, and three died. The median age of patients was 7.5 years(range: 0-74 years). Idaho     Following the outbreak report from Washington, the Division of Health,Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, identified 14 persons with cultureconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection, with illness onset dates from December11, 1992, through February 16, 1993 (Figure 2A). Four persons werehospitalized; one developed HUS. During the week preceding illness onset, 13(93%) had eaten at a chain A restaurant. California     In late December, the San Diego County Department of Health Services wasnotified of a child with E. coli O157:H7 infection who subsequently died.Active surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons withE. coli O157:H7 infections or HUS from mid-November through mid-January 1993.Four of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant andHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199four at a chain B restaurant in San Diego. After the Washington outbreak wasreported, reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27%increase in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December 1992 and January1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier. A case was defined aspostdiarrheal HUS, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured,or any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded E. coli O157:H7, withonset from November 15, 1992, through January 31, 1993.     Illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition (Figure 2B). Theoutbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients. Fourteenpersons were hospitalized, seven developed HUS, and one child died. The medianage of case-patients was 10 years (range: 1-58 years). A case-control study ofthe first 25 case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched communitycontrols implicated eating at a chain A restaurant in San Diego (matchedOR=13; 95% confidence interval CI=1.7-99). A study comparing case-patientswho ate at chain A restaurants with well meal companions implicated regularsized hamburger patties (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3).Chain B was not statistically associated with illness. Nevada     On January 22, after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eatenat a local chain A restaurant, the Clark County (Las Vegas) Health Districtissued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrheacontact the health department. A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS, bloodydiarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illnesswith a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E. coli O157:H7, withonset from December 1, 1992, through February 7, 1993. Because locallaboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) medium to screen stoolsfor E. coli O157:H7, this organism was not identified in any patient. AfterSMAC medium was distributed, the outbreak strain was detected in the stool ofone patient 38 days after illness onset.     Of 58 persons whose illnesses met the case definition (Figure 2C), ninewere hospitalized; three developed HUS. The median age was 30.5 years (range:0-83 years). Analysis of the first 21 patients identified and age- and sexmatched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant duringthe week preceding illness onset (matched OR=undefined; lower confidencelimit=4.9). A case-control study using well meal companions of case-patientsalso implicated eating hamburgers at chain A (matched OR=6.0; 95% CI=0.749.8). Other Investigation Findings     During the outbreak, chain A restaurants in Washington linked with casesprimarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on November19, 1992; some of the same meat was used in "jumbo" patties produced onNovember 20, 1992. The outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from 11lots of patties produced on those two dates; these lots had been distributedto restaurants in all states where illness occurred. Approximately 272,672(20%) of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall.     A meat traceback by a CDC team identified five slaughter plants in theUnited States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in theHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199contaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducingthe likelihood of contamination. The animals slaughtered in domestic slaughterplants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states. No oneslaughter plant or farm was identified as the source.     Further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission infamilies and child day care settings is ongoing.Reported by: M Davis, DVM, C Osaki, MSPH, Seattle-King County Dept of PublicHealth; D Gordon, MS, MW Hinds, MD, Snohomish Health District, Everett; KMottram, C Winegar, MPH, Tacoma-Pierce County Health Dept; ED Avner, MD, PITarr, MD, Dept of Pediatrics, D Jardine, MD, Depts of Anesthesiology andPediatrics, Univ of Washington School of Medicine and Children's Hospital andMedical Center, Seattle; M Goldoft, MD, B Bartleson, MPH; J Lewis, JMKobayashi, MD, State Epidemiologist, Washington Dept of Health.

Div of Field Epidemiology, Epidemiology Program Office; EntericDiseases Br, Div of Bacterial and Mycotic Diseases, National Center forInfectious Diseases, CDC.Editorial Note: E. coli O157:H7 is a pathogenic gram-negative bacterium firstidentified as a cause of illness in 1982 during an outbreak of severe bloodydiarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers (2). This pathogen has sinceemerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS, the most commoncause of acute renal failure in children. Outbreak investigations have linkedmost cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef, although otherfood vehicles, including roast beef, raw milk, and apple cider, also have beenimplicated (3). Preliminary data from a CDC 2-year, nationwide, multicenterstudy revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E. coli O157:H7that organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of 10participating hospitals and was isolated from 7.8% of all bloody stools, ahigher rate than for any other pathogen.     Infection with E. coli O157:H7 often is not recognized because mostclinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism onHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199SMAC medium, and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnessesassociated with infection (4). The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea(often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent. Younger age groupsand the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations andcomplications. Illness usually resolves after 6-8 days, but 2%-7% of patientsdevelop HUS, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia,renal failure, and a death rate of 3%-5%.     This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing communityoutbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 in the absence of routine surveillance. Despitethe magnitude of this outbreak, the problem may not have been recognized inthree states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington(1). Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens frompersons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E. coli O157:H7 using SMAC agar (5).When infections with E. coli O157:H7 are identified, they should be reportedto local health departments for further evaluation and, if necessary, publichealth action to prevent further cases.     E. coli O157:H7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, and cancontaminate meat during slaughter. CDC is collaborating with the U.S.Department of Agriculture's Food Safety Inspection Service to identifycritical control points in processing as a component of a program to reducethe likelihood of pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7 entering the meat supply.Because slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat withpathogens, and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogensfrom the surface of the meat to the interior, ground beef is likely to beinternally contaminated. The optimal food protection practice is to cookground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink, and the juicesare clear. In this outbreak, undercooking of hamburger patties likely playedan important role. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued interimrecommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to155 F (86.1 C) (FDA, personal communication, 1993).     Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this reportand the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could beconsumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations ofoutbreaks. The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation ofthis pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infectionscaused by E. coli O157:H7 and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of E.coli O157:H7.Reference1.

Long-term use ofsmokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk oforal cancer (2) -- the incidence of which could increase if young persons whocurrently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently (1).To monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products,CDC's 1991 National Health Interview Survey-Health Promotion and DiseasePrevention supplement (NHIS-HPDP) collected information on snuff and chewingtobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian,noninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years. Thisreport summarizes findings from this survey.     The 1991 NHIS-HPDP supplement asked "Have you used snuff at least 20times in your entire life?" and "Do you use snuff now?" Similar questions wereasked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking. Current users ofsmokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobaccouse at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at thetime of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported havingused snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at thetime of the interview. Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current andformer users. Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking atleast 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers asthose who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were notsmoking now. Ever smokers included current and former smokers. Data onsmokeless tobacco use were available for 43,732 persons aged greater than orequal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to providenational estimates. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by usingstandard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN)(3).     In 1991, an estimated 5.3 million (2.9%) U.S. adults were current usersof smokeless tobacco, including 4.8 million (5.6%) men and 533,000 (0.6%)women. For all categories of comparison, the prevalence of smokeless tobaccouse was substantially higher among men. For men, the prevalence of use washighest among those aged 18-24 years (Table 1); for women, the prevalence washighest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. The prevalence ofsmokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Indians/AlaskanNatives and whites; the prevalence among women was highest among AmericanIndians/Alaskan Natives and blacks. Among both men and women, prevalence ofsmokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education. Prevalence wassubstantially higher among residents of the southern United States and inrural areas. Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher amongHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 1Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199men and women below the poverty level, * this difference was significant onlyfor women (p less than 0.05) (Table 1).     Among men, the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among thoseaged 18-44 years but varied considerably by age; the prevalence of use ofchewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group (Table 2). Althoughwomen rarely used smokeless tobacco, the prevalence of snuff use was highestamong those aged greater than or equal to 75 years.     An estimated 7.9 million (4.4% 95% CI=4.1-4.6) adults reported beingformer smokeless tobacco users. Among ever users, the proportion who wereformer smokeless tobacco users was 59.9% (95% CI=57.7-62.1). Among personsaged 18-24 years, the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users(56.2% 95% CI=49.4-63.0) than among chewing tobacco users (70.4% 95%CI=64.2-76.6). Among persons aged 45-64 years, the proportion of former userswas similar for snuff (68.9% 95% CI=63.1-74.7) and chewing tobacco (73.5%95% CI=68.9-78.1).     Among current users of smokeless tobacco, 22.9% (95% CI=19.9-26.0)currently smoked, 33.3% (95% CI=30.0-36.5) formerly smoked, and 43.8% (95%CI=39.9-47.7) never smoked. In comparison, among current smokers, 2.6% (95%CI=2.3-3.0) were current users of smokeless tobacco.     Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users (67.3%95% CI=63.2-71.4) than among chewing tobacco users (45.1% 95% CI=40.649.6).Reported by: Office on Smoking and Health, National Center for Chronic DiseasePrevention and Health Promotion; Div of Health Interview Statistics, NationalCenter for Health Statistics, CDC.Editorial Note: The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokelesstobacco was highest among young males. Adolescent and young adult males, inparticular, are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies thatlink smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility. Use of oralsnuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players, encouraging thisbehavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk fornicotine addiction, oral cancer, and other mouth disorders (4).     Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use amongracial/ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levelsand socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that requirefurther explanation. For example, targeted marketing practices may play a rolein maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups, and affecting thedifferential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons (5,6).     In this report, one concern is that nearly one fourth of currentsmokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes. In the 1991 NHIS-HPDP, theprevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobaccousers than among current and never smokeless tobacco users. In a previousstudy among college students, 18% of current smokeless tobacco users smokedHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 1Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199occasionally (7). In addition, approximately 7% of adults who formerly smokedreported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort tostop smoking (8). Health-care providers should recognize the potential healthimplications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use.     The national health objectives for the year 2000 have established specialpopulation target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokelesstobacco use, including males aged 12-24 years (to no more than 4% by the year2000 objective 3.9) and American Indian/Alaskan Native youth (to no morethan 10% by the year 2000 objective 3.9a) (9). Strategies to lower theprevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokelesstobacco use, integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco-control efforts,enforcing laws that restrict minors' access to tobacco, making excise taxescommensurate with those on cigarettes, encouraging health-care providers toroutinely provide cessation advice and follow-up, providing school-basedprevention and cessation interventions, and adopting policies that prohibittobacco use on school property and at school-sponsored events (5).Reference1.

The Seattle-based study showed that roughly one in eight emergency visitsfor asthma in that city was linked to exposure to particulate air pollution. The actual exposure levels recorded in the study were far below those deemedunsafe under federal air quality laws.      "People with asthma have inflamed airways, and airborne particles tend toexacerbate that inflammation," said Joel Schwartz, Ph.D., of the EnvironmentalProtection Agency, who was the lead author of the study.  "When people are onthe threshold of having, a serious asthma attack, particles can push them overthe edge."     The Seattle Study correlated 13 months of asthma emergency room visitswith daily levels of PM,,,. or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameterof 10 microns or less.  These finer particles are considered hazardous becausethey are small enough penetrate into the lung.  Cities are considered out ofcompliance with clean air laws if the 24-hour average concentration of PM10exceeds 150 micrograms per cubic millimeter of air.      In Seattle however, a link between fine particles and asthma was found atlevels as low as 30 micrograms.  The authors concluded that for every 30microgram increase in the four-day average of PM10, the odds of someone withasthma needing emergency treatment increased by 12 percent.      The findings were published in the April American Review of RespiratoryDisease, an official journal of the American Thoracic Society, the LungAssociation's medical section.      The study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest thatparticulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat.  A 1992 studyby Dr. Schwartz and Douglas Dockery, Ph.D., of Harvard found that particlesmay be causing roughly 60,000 premature deaths each year in the United States. Other studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptomsand bronchitis in children.      "Government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone,"says Dr. Schwartz.  "But more and more research is showing that particles arebad actors as well."      One problem in setting, standards for particulateair pollution is that PMIO is difficult to study.  Unlike other regulatedpollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide, particulate matter is a complexand varying mixture of substances, including carbon, hydrocarbons, dust, andHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 2Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199acid aerosols.      "Researchers can\'t Put people in exposure chambers to study the effectsof particulate air pollution," says Dr. Schwartz.  "We have no way ofduplicating the typical urban mix of particles.  " Consequently, most of whatis known about particulates has been learned through population-based researchlike the Seattle study.      Given that the EPA's current priority is to review the ozone and sulfurdioxide standards, the agency is unlikely to reexamine the PM10 standard anytime soon.  Until changes are made, there appears to be little people withasthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles     "In some areas, you can get reports on air quality, but the reports onlycover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard, and that'srarely particulate matter," says Dr.  Schwartz.  "However, PM10 doesn\'t haveto be near its violation range to be unhealthy.HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 3Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199               NIH Consensus Development Conference on MelanomThe National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference onDiagnosis and Treatment of Early Melanoma brought together experts indermatology, pathology, epidemiology, public education, surveillancetechniques, and potential new technologies as well as other health careprofessionals and the public to address (1) the clinical and histologicalcharacteristics of early melanoma; (2) the appropriate diagnosis, management,and followup of patients with early melanoma; (3) the role of dysplastic neviand their significance; and (4) the role of education and screening inpreventing melanoma morbidity and mortality.  Following 2 days ofpresentations by experts and discussion by the audience, a consensus panelweighed the scientific evidence and prepared their consensus statement.Among their findings, the panel recommended that (1) melanoma in situ is adistinct entity effectively treated surgically with 0.5 centimeter margins;(2) thin invasive melanoma, less than 1 millimeter thick, has the potentialfor long-term survival in more than 90 percent of patients after surgicalexcision with a 1 centimeter margin; (3) elective lymph node dissections andextensive staging evaluations are not recommended in early melanoma; (4)patients with early melanoma are at low risk for relapse but may be at highrisk for development of subsequent melanomas and should be followed closely;(5) some family members of patients with melanoma are at increased risk formelanoma and should be enrolled in surveillance programs; and (6) educationand screening programs have the potential to decrease morbidity and mortalityfrom melanoma.A copy of the full text of the consensus panel's statement is available bycalling the NIH Office of Medical Applications of Research at (301) 496-1143or by writing to:  Office of Medical Applications of Research, NationalInstitutes of Health, Federal Building, Room 618, Bethesda, MD 20892HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 3Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199                         NCI-Designated Cancer CenterThe Cancer Centers Program is comprised of 55 NCI-designated Cancer Centersactively engaged in multidisciplinary research efforts to reduce cancerincidence, morbidity, and mortality.  Within the program, there are four typesof cancer centers:  basic science cancer centers (14), which engage primarilyin basic cancer research; clinical cancer centers (12), which focus onclinical research; "comprehensive" cancer centers (28), which emphasize amultidisciplinary approach to cancer research, patient care, and communityoutreach; and consortium cancer centers (1), which specialize in cancerprevention and control research.Although some cancer centers existed in the late 1960s and the 1970s, it wasthe National Cancer Act of 1971 that authorized the establishment of 15 newcancer centers, as well as continuing support for existing ones.  The passageof the act also dramatically transformed the centers' structure and broadenedthe scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic, clinical, andcancer control research.  Over the next two decades, the centers' program grewprogressively.In 1990, there were 19 comprehensive cancer centers in the nation. Today,there are 28 of these institutions, all of which meet specific NCI criteriafor comprehensive status.To attain recognition from the NCI as a comprehensive cancer center, aninstitution must pass rigorous peer review.  Under guidelines newlyestablished in 1990, the eight criteria for "comprehensiveness" include therequirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research inseveral scientific fields, such as biology and molecular genetics, a strongprogram of clinical research, and an ability to transfer research findingsinto clinical practice.Moreover, five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantlybeyond that required for attaining a Cancer Center Support Grant (alsoreferred to as a P30 or core grant), the mechanism of choice for supportingthe infrastructure of a cancer center's operations.  These criteria encompassstrong participation in NCI-designated high-priority clinical trials,significant levels of cancer prevention and control research, and importantoutreach and educational activities--all of which are funded by a variety ofsources.The other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics andcapabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploitimportant new findings or address timely research questions.HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 3Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199Of the 55 NCI-designated Cancer Centers, 14 are of the basic science type. These centers engage almost entirely in basic research, although some centersengage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigatorsand in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applicationsfrom new discoveries in the laboratory.Clinical cancer centers, in contrast, focus on both basic research andclinical research within the same institutional framework, and frequentlyincorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into theiroverall research programs.  There are 12 such centers today.Finally, consortium cancer centers, of which there is one, are uniquelystructured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention andcontrol research.  These centers interface with state and local public healthdepartments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective preventionand control techniques from their research findings to those institutionsresponsible for implementing population-wide public health programs. Consortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations withinstitutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate communityhospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials.Together, the 55 NCI-Designated Cancer Centers continue to work towardcreating new and innovative approaches to cancer research, and throughinterdisciplinary efforts, to effectively move this research from thelaboratory into clinical trials and into clinical practice.Comprehensive Cancer Centers (Internet addresses are given where available)University of Alabama at Birmingham Comprehensive Cancer CenteBasic Health Sciences Building, Room 101918 University BoulevarBirmingham, Alabama 3529(205) 934-661University of Arizona Cancer Cente1501 North Campbell AvenuTucson, Arizona 8572(602) 626-637Internet:  syd@azcc.arizona.edJonsson Comprehensive Cancer CenteUniversity of California at Los Angele200 Medical PlazLos Angeles, California 9002(213) 206-027HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 3Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199Internet:  rick@jccc.medsch.ucla.edKenneth T.

Thedecision ends the controversy between Army AIDS researchers who had hoped totest a vaccine made by  MicroGeneSys Inc. and the National Institutes ofHealth, which  contended that multiple vaccines should be tested.  Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said a final announcement  on thetherapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last  Friday.  Companiesincluding Genentech Inc., Chiron Corp., and  Immuno AG have already told NIHthat they are prepared to  participate in the vaccine tests.  The testing isintended to  demonstrate whether AIDS vaccines are effective in thwarting the replication of HIV in patients already infected.  Shalala refuted last week'sreports that the Clinton administration had decided  the Army's test of theMicroGeneSys VaxSyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time. "The report was inaccurate,  and I expect there to be some announcement in thenext 24 hours  about that particular AIDS research project," said Shalala.  Administration sources subsequently confirmed that NIH director  Dr. BernadineHealy and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler hadconvinced the White House that multiple  vaccines should be testedsimultaneously.  But MicroGeneSys  president Frank Volvovitz said a test ofmultiple vaccines could  triple the cost of the trial and delay it by twoyears==================================================================   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 4Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199"The Limits of AZT\'s Impact on HIV" U.S. News & World Report (04/12/93) Vol.114, No. 14, P. 18     AZT has become the most widely used drug to fight AIDS since it  wasapproved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1987.   Burroughs Wellcome,the manufacturer of AZT, made $338 million  last year alone from sales of thedrug.  However, a team of  European researchers recently reported thatalthough HIV-positive patients taking AZT demonstrated a slightly lower riskof  developing AIDS within the first year of treatment, that benefit disappeared two years later.  The Lancet published preliminary  findings ofthe three-year study, which could give more reason  for critics to argue thedrug's cost, side effects, and general  efficacy.  Even though U.S.researchers concede the study was  more comprehensive than American trials,many argue the European  researchers' suggestion that HIV-positive patientsexperience  little improvement in their illness before the development of AIDS symptoms.

Living things maintain small electric fields to (1) enhance certaichemical reactions, (2) promote communication of states with in a cell(3) communicate between cells (of which the nervous system is a specializeexample), and perhaps other uses.  These electric fields change with locatioand time in a large organism.  Special photographic techniques such as applyinexternal fields in Kirillian photography interact with these fields or the resistancecaused by these fields to make interesting pictures. Perhaps such pictures wilbe diagonistic of disease problems in organisms when better understood. Perhaps notStudying the overall electric activity of biological systems is several hundreyears old, but not a popular activity.  Perhaps, except in the case of a fetissues like nerves and the electric senses of fishes, it is hard to reduce thinvestigation into small pieces that can be clearly analyzed.  There are somhints that manipulating electric fields is a useful therapy such as speedinthe healing of broken bones, but not understood whyBioelectricity has a long association with mysticism. Ideas such as Frankensteireanimation go back to the most early electrical experiments on tissue such awhen Volta invented the battery.

HelloI am interested in trying this "desensitization" (?) methoagainst hay feverWhat is the state of affairs about this. I went to a doctor anpaid $85 for a 10 minute interview + 3 scratches, leading to thdiagnostic that I am allergic to (June and Timothy) grassI believe this. From now on it looks like 2 shots per week fo6 months followed by 1 shot per month or so. Each shot cost$20. Talking about soaring costs and the Health care system, I woulcall that a racket. We are not talking about rare Amazonian grassehere, but the garbage which grows behind the doctor's officeApart from this issue, I was somewhat disappointed to find outhat you have to keep getting the shots forever. Is that rightThanks for informationEj

Indurkhy                      TUTORIAL PROGRATutorials will be conducted at the Bethesda Ramada Hotel onTuesday, July 612:00-2:45pm "Introduction to Molecular Biology for Computer Scientists"  Prof. Mick Noordewier (Rutgers UniversityThis overview of the essential facts of molecular biology isintended as an introduction to the field for computer scientistswho wish to apply their tools to this rich and complex domain. Material covered will include structural and informationalmolecules, the basic organization of the cell and of geneticmaterial, the "central dogma" of gene expression, and selectedother topics in the area of structure, function, and regulation asrelates to current computational approaches.  Dr. Noordewier hasappointments in both Computer Science and Biology at Rutgers, andhas extensive experience in basic biological research in additionto his current work in computational biology12:00-2:45pm "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for Biologists"  Dr. Richard Lathrop (MIT & Arris Corp.An overview of the field of artificial intelligence will bepresented, as it relates to actual and potential biologicalapplications.  Fundamental techniques, symbolic programminglanguages, and notions of search will be discussed, as well asselected topics in somewhat greater detail, such as knowledgerepresentation, inference, and machine learning.  The intendedaudience includes biologists with some computational background,but no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence.  Dr.Lathrop, co-developer of ARIADNE and related technologies, hasworked in the area of artificial intelligence applied tobiological problems in both academia and industry3:00-5:45pm "Neural Networks, Statistics, and Information Theory in Biological Sequence Analysis" Dr. Alan Lapedes (Los Alamos National Laboratory)This tutorial will cover the most rapidly-expanding facet ofintelligent systems for molecular biology, that of machinelearning techniques applied to sequence analysis.  Closelyinterrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artificalneural networks to elicit both specific signals and generalcharacteristics of sequences, and the relationship of suchapproaches to statistical techniques and information-theoreticviews of sequence data.  Dr. Lapedes, of the TheoreticalDivision at Los Alamos, has long been a leader in the use of suchtechniques in this domain3:00-5:45pm "Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming" Prof. John Koza (Stanford UniversityThe genetic algorithm, an increasingly popular approach to highlynon-linear multi-dimensional optimization problems, was originallyinspired by a biological metaphor.  This tutorial will cover boththe biological motivations, and the actual implementation andcharacteristics of the algorithm.  Genetic Programming, anextension well-suited to problems where the discovery of the sizeand shape of the solution is a major part of the problem, willalso be addressed.  Particular attention will be paid tobiological applications, and to identifying resources and softwarethat will permit attendees to begin using the methods.  Dr. Koza,a Consulting Professor of Computer Science at Stanford, has taughtthis subject since 1988 and is the author of a standard text inthe field3:00-5:45pm "Linguistic Methods in Sequence Analysis" Prof. David Searls (University of Pennsylvania) & Shmuel Pietrokovski (Weizmann InstituteApproaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologiesare increasingly in evidence.  These involve the adaptation oftools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntacticpattern recognition and gene prediction, the classification ofgenetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory, theidentification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codesin sequence data, and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic andfunctional relatedness.  Dr. Searls, who holds research facultyappointments in both Genetics and Computer Science at Penn,represents the branch of this field that considers higher-ordersyntactic approaches to sequence data, while Shmuel Pietrokovskihas studied and published with Prof. Edward Trifinov in the areaof word-based analyses                      REGISTRATION FORMail, with check made out to "ISMB-93", to               ISMB Conference, c/o J.

Iis interesting & written at a level which I think many sci.med readers woulappreciate -- which is:  it assumes an intelligent reader who is capable ounderstanding scientific concepts, but who may not yet have been exposed tthis particular information.

What he does NO\tmake reference to is the fact that the study was performed not o\thumans but on rabbits\tOne of the researchers who conducted the study, pharmacologis\tPatricia Williams, Ph.D., says it certainly is conceivable tha\ta small minority of people are sensitive enough to MSG to get\theadaches from it.  'But,' she explains, 'the show probably\toveremphasized the extent of the problem.\tA second lapse comes with mention of Dr. John Olney, a professo\tat the Washington University School of Medicine who, Mr. Bradle\tremarks, 'says that his 20 years of research with laborator\tanimals shows MSG is a hazard for developing youngsters' becaus\tit poses a threat of irreversible brain damage.  Dr. Olney'\tresearch with lab animals does not 'show' anything about huma\tyoungsters\tIn fact, only under extreme circumsrtances did Dr. Olney's\texperiments ever bring about any brain damage: when he injecte\textremely high doses of MSG into rodents, completely bypassing\ttheir digestive tracts and entering their bloodstreams more directly\tand when he used tubes to force-feed huge amounts of the substanc\tto very young animals on an empty stomach.  Of course, neithe\tof those procedures occurs with humans; they simply take in MSG\twith food.  And most of what they take in is broken down b\tenzymes in the wall of the small intestine, so that very littl\treaches the bloodstream -- much to little, in fact, for huma\tblood levels of MSG to come anywhere near the high concentration\tfound in Dr. Olney's lab animals....\tThe World Health Organization appears to be very much aware o\tthat fact.

Without knowing more it is nopossible to say whether the obstruction is permanent due to scarringor temporary due to swelling of inflammed intestine.  In general, there arno dietary limitations in patients with Crohn's except as they relatto obstruction.  There is no evidence that any foods will bring onrecurrence of Crohn's.  It is important to distinguish recurrence frorecurrent symptoms.  A physician would think of new inflammation asrecurrence, while pains from raw veggies just imply a narrowing of thintestine.

I can not believe the way this thread on candida(yeast) has progressedSteve Dyer and I have been exchanging words over the same topic in Sci.Med. Nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a womenposter for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that didnot exist.  Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible Steve and Isee that you and some of the others are doing it here as well. Let me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who haveno idea how the human body interacts with it's environment and how thatbalance can be altered by diet and antibiotics.  These are the physicianswho dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them gofrom doctor to doctor to find relief(like Elaine in Sci. Med. Nutrition) andthen when they find one that solves their problem, the rest start yellingquack.  Could it just be professional jealousy?  I couldn't help Elaine or Jobut somebody else did.  Could they know more than Me?  No way, they must be aquack. I've been teaching a human nutrition course for Medical students for over tenyears now and guess who the most receptive students are?  Those that wereraised on farms and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of theirfarm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior toentering medical school(switched to the vegan diet).  Typically, this isabout 1/3 of my class of 90 students.  Those not interested in nutritioneither tune me out or just stop coming to class.  That's okay because Iknow that some of what I'm teaching is going to stick and there will be atleast a few "enlightened" physicians practicing in the U.S.  It\'s reallytoo bad that most U.S. medical schools don't cover nutrition because ifthey did, candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in themedical professionIn animal husbandry, an animal is reinnoculated with "good" bacteria afterantibiotics are stopped.  Medicine has decided that since humans do nothave a ruminant stomach, no such reinnoculation with "good" bacteria isneeded after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic.  Humans have allkinds of different organisms living in the GI system(mouth, stomach, smalland large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.  These arenonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immunesystem is compromised.  They are also called nonpathogens because unlikethe pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not producetoxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body.  But any ofthese organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take upresidence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let thishappen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrierSteve got real upset with Elaine's doctor because he was using anti-fungalsand vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood whatvitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be callingElaine's doctor a quackHere is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonlycalled, are not truely caused by yeasts.  The most common organism responsiblfor this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually ayeast-like fungus.  An infection caused by this organism is called candidiasisCandidiasis is a very rare occurance because, like an E. Coli infection, itrequires that the host immune system be severly depressed. Candida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes ofnormal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposinfactor is present such as a high blood glucose level(diabetes) or an oralcourse of antibiotics has been used.  In diabetics, their secretions containmuch higher amounts of glucose.  Candida, unlike bacteria, is very limited init's food(fuel) selection.  Without glucose, it can not grow, it just barelysurvives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over ridesthe other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  Indiabetics, skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these littlebuggers.  The bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people butsome people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucusmembrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction tothe candida or not isn't certain.  When the bloom is in the vagina or onthe skin, it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to "treat" itIf it's internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are prettynondiscript. Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora inthe sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in thevaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune systemususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unlessthey broach the mucus membrane "barrier".  If they do, an inflammatoryresponse will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin Afrom their diets.  About 30% of all American's die with less Vitamin A thanthey were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitaminA does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membranebarrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a stronginflammatory response after a candida bloom. While diabetics can suffer from a candida "bloom" the  most common cause ofthis type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics whichknock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the maincompetition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs areavailable to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will notuse them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity ofthe anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinusinflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrumantibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriatejust as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurringvaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer saysBut even in patients being given the anti-fungals, the irritation caused bythe excessive candida bloom in the sinus, GI tract or the vagina tends toreturn after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause ofthe problem is addressed(lack of a "good" bacterial flora in the body and/orpoor mucus membrane barrier).  Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effectivetherapy for candida overgrowth.  From it's name, it is an acid lovingorganism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows.  Candida can notgrow very well in an acidic environment.  In the vagina, L. acidophilius isthe predominate bacteria(unless you are hit with broad spectrumantibiotics). In the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly goodreservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a veryfavorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture andhumidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways tominimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear. If the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and evenblood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If thebloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatologyoccurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stoolfor occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the firstplace.  After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrongbut her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor, and so on.  Richard Kaplanhas told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stoolspecimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number offalse positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constantbasis, I would want it fixed.  Yes it's nice to know that I don't havecolon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find adoctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quackCandida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteriatend to prefer a slightly acidic environment.  The vagina becomes alkalineduring a woman's period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina.Vinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginalproblems.  Many women have also gotten relief from the introduction ofLactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract(I would want to be sure ofthe purity of the product before trying this).  My wife had this vaginaproblem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a yearuntil she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writtingscripts for anti-fungal creams.  This was a woman gynocologist who had hadthe same problem(recurring vaginal yeast infections).  This M.D. did somedigging and came up with an acetic acid and L. Acidophilis douche which sheused in your office to keep it sterile.  After three treatments, sexreturned to our marraige.  I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronicGI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells hispatients is a non-existent syndromeThe nonpathogenic bacteria L. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteriawhich is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women. If taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.  Througharesol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranesBut before this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier systemneeds to be strengthened.  This is accomplished by vitamin A, vitamin C andsome of the B-complex vitamins.  Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americansare not getting enough B6 and folate.  These are probably the segement ofthe population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existentdisorder(candida blooms after antibiotic therapy)Some of the above material was obtained from "Natural Healing" by MarkBricklin, Published by Rodale press, as well as notes from my humannutrition course.  I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A  sometime inthe future, along with reference citings to point out the extremelyimportant role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system inthe body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candidablooms.  Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrateintake during the treatment phase, this is especially important if the GIsystem is involved.  If candida can not get glucose, it's not going to outgrow the bacteria and you then give bacteria, which can use amino acids andfatty acids for energy, a chance to take over and keep the candida in checkonce carbohydrate is returned to the gutIf Steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post,fine.  I jumped all over Steve in Sci. Med. Nutrition because he verbablyaccosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor's use of vitaminA and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut.  People seeking advicefrom newsnet should not be treated this way.  Those of us giving of ourtime and knowledge can slug it out to our heart's content.

After about 6 months on thshots, most of those symptoms were gone, and they haven't come back.  stopped getting the shots (due more to laziness than planning) in collegeMy allergies got a little worse after that, but are still nowhere near abad as they used to be.

Whilemost work in hospitals and clinics, many major cities will have RD's whoare in "private practice" so to speak.  Many physicans will refer theirpatients with Crohn's disease to RD's for dietary help.  If you can getyour friend's physician to make a referral, medical insurance should pay forthe RD's services just like the services of a physical therapist.  Thebetter medical insurance plans will cover this but even if your friend'splan doesn't, it would be well worth the cost to get on a good diet tocontrol the intestinal discomfort and help the intestinal lining healCrohn's disease is an inflammatory disease of the intestinal lining andlipoxygenase inhibitors may help by decreasing leukotriene formation butI'm not aware of tea or turmeric containing lipoxygenase inhibitors.

The best way of self injection is to use the right size needland choose the correct spot. For Streptomycin, usually given intrmuscularly, use a thin needle (23/24 guage) and select a spot othe upper, outer thigh (no major nerves or blood vessels there).Clean the area with antiseptic before injection, and after. Maksure to inject deeply (a different kind of pain is felt when thneedle enters the muscle - contrasted to the 'prick' when itpierces the skin)PS: Try to go to a doctor.

In the generapopulation, NT's comprise only about 12% of the population, but amonphysicians it is much much higher (I don't know the exact percentage any help here a.p.p.er's?One driving characteristic of an NT, especially an NTJ, is their obvioucholeric behavior (driver, type A, etc.) - the extreme emotional need tcontrol, to lead, and/or to be the best or the most competent.  If they aralso extroverted, they are best described as "Field Marshalls".  This traiis very valuable and essential in our society - we need people who want tlead, to strive to overcome the elements, to seek and thirst for knowledgeto raise the level of competency, etc.  The great successes in science antechnology are in large part due to the vision (an N trait) and scientificallyminded approach (T trait) of the NT personality (of course, the other typeand temperaments have their own positive contributions as well).  Howeverwhen the NT person has self-image challenges, the "dark-side" of thipersonality type usually comes out, which should be obvious to allA physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper theitemperament will be extremely business-like (lack of empathy or feeling)and is very compelled to have total control over their patient (the patienmust be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question).  I'vknown many M.D.'s of this temperament and suffice to say I don't oblige thewith a followup visit, no matter how competent I think they are (and theusually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is aextreme drive of theirs - to know the most, to know it all)Maybe we need more NF doctor's.  :^Enough on this subject - let's move on to candida bloom>Let me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have>no idea how the human body interacts with it's environment and how that>balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics...

Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low.  My sinusewere a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damagedI also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  In the end, even two weekof Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacteriainfection of the sinuses via cat-scans, mucus color (won't get into thdetails), and other symptoms.  Three very traditional ENT's made thidiagnosis (I did not have any cultures done, however, because of thdifficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showea bacterial infection).  Enough of this background (provided to help younderstand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungatherapy below)The first question I have is this.  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poomucus membrane tissue, maybe via hyphae, thus causing symptoms, without beinconsidered 'systemic' in the classic sense?

If Steve really understoood what>vitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling>Elaine's doctor a quackI was concerned, too, because of the toxicity of vitamin A.  My doctor, aftemy blood tests, put me on 75,000 IU of vitamin A for one week only, thedropped it down to 25,000 IU for the next couple of weeks.  I also receivezinc and other supplementation, since all of these interrelate in fairlcomplex ways as my doctor explained (he's one of those 'evil' orthomoleculaspecialists).  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normalhe then stopped me on all vitamin A (except for some in a multi-vitaminsupplement), and made sure that I maintain a 50,000 IU/day of beta caroteneCall me carrot face.  :^Hopefully, Elaine's doctor will take a similar, careful approach and tall supplements.  I'm even reevaluating some supplements I'm taking, foexample, niacin in fairly large dosages, 1 gram/day, which Steve Dyer hagood information about on sci.med.nutrition.  If niacin only has second-ordeimprovement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies, then it probably inot worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage>survives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides>the other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  InThough I do now believe, based on my successful therapy with Sporanox, thaI definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in msinuses, I still want to ask the question:  have there been any studies thademonstrate candida "blooms" in the sinuses with associated sinus irritatio(sinusitis/rhinitis)?  (My sinus irritation reduced significantly after onweek of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during thitime - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting oSporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considerenormal)BTW, my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry, can'remember which one), and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950'which stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-seriousaspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinuinflammation symptoms.  I'll have to dig out that reference again since iis relevant to this discussion>some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus>membrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to>the candida or not isn't certainMy doctor tested me (I believe a RAST or RAST similar test) for allergiresponse to specificially Candida albicans, and I showed a strong positiveAnother question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this tesis essentially useless?  And, assuming it is true that Candida can gropart-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds athreshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy tCandida definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membranirritation due to the body's allergic response?  As I said in an earlier postone does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a M.D. degree or aPh.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesisBTW, and I\'ll repost this again.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, "Sinus Survival"has routinely given, before anything else, Nizoral (a pre-Sporanox systemianti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as Sporanox) to his new chronisinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times ithe last two years.  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well ove90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but idoesn't cure it by any means, implying the so-called yeast/fungus infectiois not the primary cause, but a later complication.  He's also found thanystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not helpThis implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom iaggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partwainto the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than bdirect contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  Again, I admitlots of 'ifs', and 'implies', which doesn't please the hard-core NT whhas to have the double-blind study or it's a non-issue, but one has to starwith some plausible hypothesis/explanation, a strawman, if you will>If it's internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty>nondescript. This brings up an interesting observation used by those who will denand reject any and all aspects of the 'yeast hypothesis' until thappropriate studies are done.  And that is if you can't observe or culturthe yeast "bloom" in the gut or sinus, then there\'s no way to diagnose oeven recognize the disease.  And I know they realize that it is virtuallimpossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannobe easily observed since candida is everywhere in the bodyIt's a real Catch-22Another Catch-22:  Those who totally reject the 'yeast hypothesis' say thano studies have been done (actually studies have been done, but if it's noup to a certain standard then it is, from their perspective, a non-study whicshould not even be considered).  I agree that the appropriate studies shoulbe done, and that will take big $ to do it right.  However, in order tconvince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their walletsyou literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence tcompete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact studneeded funding.  That is, you have to do 90% of the study before you even gefunding (as a scientist at a National Lab, I'm very aware of this for thsmaller funded projects).  I'm afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 othedoctors got together, pooled their practice's case histories and anecdoteinto a compelling picture, and approach the funding agencies, they would genowhere, even if they were able to publish their statistical resultsIt is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they hav*decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading tnoticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenablhypothesis, so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidencto the contrary will never change their mind, and not only that, they woulalso oppose the needed studies because in their minds it's a done issue -excessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not, wilnot, and cannot exist.  Period.  Kind of tough to dialog with those who holsuch a viewpoint.

You can continue to kill the surface, such as nystatin does, buyou can't kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemianti-fungal such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or some of the older ones sucas Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  This is why, as habeen pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor I've been ie-mail contact with - thanks), that nystatin is not effective in the longterm treatment of GI tract "candidiasis".  It\'s like trying to weed a gardeby cutting off what's above the ground but leaving the roots ready to comout again once you walk awayThe $60000 question is whether a contained candida "bloom" can partiallgrow into tissue through the mucus membranes, causing some types of symptomin susceptible people (e.g., allergy), without becoming "systemic" in thclassical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessivbloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection thais potentially lethal>In the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good>reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very>favorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and>humidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.

When I finally find a>doctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quackAs I've said in private e-mail, there are flaws in our current medical systethat make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempalternative therapies AFTER the approved/proven/accepted therapies don't workFor example, I went to three ENT's, who all said that I will just have to livwith my acute/chronic sinusitis after the ab's failed (they did mentiosurgery to open up the ostia, but my ostia weren't plugged and it would noget to the root cause of my condition).  After three months of aggressive anfairly non-standard therapy (Sporanox, body nutrient level monitoring anequalization, vitamin C, lentinen, echinacea, etc.), my health has vastlimproved to where I was two years ago, before my health greatly deterioratedOf course, skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would havimproved anyway, but that view is stretching things quite far because of thexperience of the three ENT\'s I saw who said that I\'d just have to "live witit".  I\'m confident I will reach what one could call a total "cure".  Thanti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that directiobecause of my overuse of ab's for the last four years.  (Note:  for thoshaving sinus problems, may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention aboveBe sure to get the revised edition.>...I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic>GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his>patients is a non-existent syndromeDr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems, and hivisits to several ENT\'s totally floored him when they said "you\'ll just havto live with it".  He spent several years trying everything - standard annon-standard, until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  He noshares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the roato recovery following some parts of it.  His one recommendation to take systemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history oanti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his owpractice.  I'm sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti"yeast hypothesis" posters that he would have definite things to say, such as"it\'s worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases", to put it mildlyI also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violatintheir moral obligations to help the patientMaybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and arconfronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the "hypotheticayeast overgrowth" (e.g., they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast peoplhave identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenuehave been exhausted.  Remember, theory and practice are two different things you cannot have one without the other, they are synergistic.  If a doctor doesomething non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over thousand of his patients, shouldn't you at least sit up and take noticeMaybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it workinstead of why it shouldn't work.  I'm afraid a lot of doctors have becomso enamored with "scientific correctness" that they are ignoring the patientthey have sworn to help.  You have to do both;  both have to be balanced, whicwe don't see from some of the posters to this group.  There comes a point wheyou just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empirical approac(such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox) after havinexhausted all the other avenues.  I was one of those who the traditionamedical establishment was not able to help, so I did the natural thing:  went to a couple of doctor's who are (somewhat) outside this establishmentand as a result I have found significant reliefWould it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set usome kind of mechanism where any doctor, without fear of being sued or havinhis license pulled, can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubttherapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all thaccepted therapies are ineffective?  I'd like to hear a doctor tell me"well, I\'ve tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in thicountry, and since they clearly don't work for you, I now have the authoritto use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  can't promise anything, and there are some risks.  You will have to sigsomething saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature othese unproven therapies, and I'll have to register your case at the StatBoard."  Anyway, if my ENT had suggested this to me, I would\'ve jumped on thipronto instead of going to one of those doctors who, for either altruistireasons, or for greed, is practicing these alternative therapies with mucrisk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to thpatient.  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicineand also provide valuable data that would essentially be free.  It also woulbe morally and ethically better than the current system by showing thcompassion of the medical community to the patient - that it's doing everythinit can within reason to help the patient.  It is the lack of such a mechanisthat is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies, some owhich seem to work (like my case), and others of which will never work at al(true quackery)I better get off my soapbox before this post reaches 500K in size>If taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.

I tend to disagree- I think anecdotal evidence, provided there is a lot of itand it is fairly consistent, will is very important.  First, it points to thnecessity of doing a study, and second, it at least says that the effects arall psychological (or possibly allergy in this case).  As I've pointed outbefore, pyschological effects are no less real than other effects.  One      person\'s "make-believe" can easily be another person\'s reality.  Usingpsychadelic drugs in a bizarre and twisted example, the hallucinations onperson experiences on an acid trip cannot be guaranteed to another person oan acid trip- there is no clinical evidence that those effects are always gointo happen.  Anyhow, that was a pretty lame example, but hopefully I made mpoint- it's all a matter of perception, and as long as someone ingesting MSperceives it as causing bad effects, then s/he can definitely experience thosaffects.  On the other hand, it could just be an allergy to the food it's in,   or something.  Still, anecdotal evidence is not worthless- it's the stuff thaleads to the study being done-Da

HiI've just returned from a visit with my OB/GYN and I have a fewconcerns that maybe y'all can help me with.  I've been seeingher every 4 weeks for the past few months (I'm at week 28)and during the last 2 visits I've gained 9 to 9 1/2 pounds every4 weeks.  She said this was unacceptable over any 4 week period.As it stands I've thus far gained 26 pounds.  Also she says thatthough I'm at 28 weeks the baby's size is 27 weeks, I think shementioned 27 inches for the top of the fundus.  When I was 13weeks the baby's size was 14 weeks.  I must also add, that I hadan operation a few years ago for endometriosis and I've had noproblems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me painin my pelvic region during the pregnancy, and I have a verydifficult time moving, and the doc has recommended I not walk ormove unless I have to. (I have a little handicapped sticker forwhen I do need to go out.)Anyway that's 1/2 of the situation the other is that almost fromthe beginning of pregnancy I was getting sick (throwing up) about2-3 times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated. (I told her about this).  I know this because I wasn't eatingvery much due to the nausea and could see the 'results'.  Wellnow I only get sick about once every 1-2 weeks, and it is still bilerelated.  But in addition I had begun to feel movement near myupper right abdomen, just below the right breast, usually when Iwas lying on my right side.  It began to get worse though becauseit started to hurt when I lay on my right side, and then it hurt no matter what position I was in.  Next, I noticed that when Iate greasy or fatty foods I felt like my entire abdomen hadturned to stone, and the pain in the area got worse.  However ifI ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to 'cut' the fat itwasn't as much of a problemSo the doctor says I have cholistatis, and that I should avoidfatty foods.  This makes sense, and because I was already awareof what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship I havebeen avoiding these foods on my own.  But I'm still able to eatfoods with Ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods. But doc wants me to be on a non-fat diet.  This means no meatexcept fish and chicken w/o skin (I do this anyway).  No nuts,fried food, cheese etc.  I am allowed skim milk.  She said Ishould avoid anything sweet (e.g. bananas).  Also I must onlyhave one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day (potatoes, pasta, rice)!  She said I can't even cook vegetables ina little bit of oil and that I should eat vegetables raw orsteamed.  I'm concerned because I understand you need to havesome fat in your diet to help in the digestive process.  And ifI'm not taking in fat, is she expecting the baby will take itfrom my stores?  And why this restriction on carbohydrates ifshe's concerned about fat?  I'm not clear how much of herrecommendation is based on my weight gain and how much oncholistatis, which I can't seem to find any information on.  Sheoriginally said that I should only gain 20 pounds during theentire pregnancy since I was about 20 lbs overweight when Istarted.  But my sister gained 60 lbs during her pregnancy andshe's taken it all off and hasn't had any problems.  She alsoasked if any members of my family were obese, which none of themare.  Anyway I think she is overly concerned about weight gain,and feel like I'm being 'punished' by a severe diet.  She didwant to see me again in one week so I think she the diet may betemporary for that one week.What I want to know is how reasonable is this non-fat diet?  Iwould understand if she had said low-fat diet, since I'm tryingthat anyway, even if she said really low-fat diet.  I think sheassumes I must be eating a high-fat diet, but really it is thatbecause of the endometriosis and the operation I'm not able touse the energy from the food I do eat.Any opinions, info and experiences will be appreciated.  I'mtruly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict dietbecause fruits and vegetables go through my system in a fewminutes and I'll end up having to eat constantly.  Thus far Idon't find any foods satisfyingThanks

Previously, low residue diets were recommended, but this advice hanow changed.  Also, there will be differences in advice in patients witand without obstructuon remaining, so input by the physician will beimportant.

I got asked in Sci. Med. Nutrition about vitamin C and oxalate productiontoxic, kidney stone formation?).  I decided to post my answer here as wellbecause of the recent question about kidney stones.  Not long after I gotinto Sci. Med. I got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesiumwould prevent kidney stone formation.  I'm going to state it again hereBut the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take B6supplements.  Read on to find out why(I have my asbestos suit on now guys)Vitamin C will form oxalic acid.  But large doses are needed (above 6 gramsper day)\t1. Review Article "Nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney\t   stones with particular emphasis on Vitamin C" Int. Clin. Nutr. Rev\t   5(3):110-129(1985)But glycine also forms oxalic acid(D-amino acid oxidases).  For bothglycine and vitamin C, one of the best ways to drastically reduce thisproduction is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin C or glycine,but to increase your intake of vitamin B6\t2. "Control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in\t    patients with kidney stones" Int. Urol. Nephrol. 20(4):353-59(1988\t    200 to 500 mg of B6 each day significasntly decreased the urinary\t    excretion of oxalate over the 18 month treatment program\t3. The action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria" Clin. Sci. 3\t   :277-86(1970).  Patients receiving at least 150mg B6 each day\t   showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levelsFor gylcine, this effect is due to increased transaminase activity(B6 isrequired for transaminase activity) which makes less glycine available foroxidative deamination(D-amino acid oxidases).  For vitamin C, the effect isquite different.  There are different pathways for vitamin C catabolism. The pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have 17 to 40%of the ingested dose going into oxalic acid.  But this is highly variableand the vitamin C review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto6 grams per day, not too much vitamin C gets catabolized to form oxalicacid.  At very high doses of vitamin C(above 10 grams per day), more of theextra vitamin C (more than 40% conversion) can end up as oxalic acid.  In avery early study on vitamin C and oxalic production(Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol.Med. 85:190-92(1954), intakes of 2 grams per day up to 9 grams per dayincreased the average oxalic acid excretion from 38mg per day up to 178mgper day.  Until 8 grams per day was reached, the average excreted wasincreased by only 3 to 12mg per day(2 gram dose, 4 gram dose, 8 gram doseand 9gram dose). 8 grams jumped it to 45mg over the average excretionbefore supplementation and 9 grams jumped it to 150 mg over the averagebefore supplementationB6 is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body.  Thereare probably some enzymes that require vitamin B6 that we don't know aboutyet.  Vitamin C catabolism is still not completely understood but thespeculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid musthave an enzyme in it that requires B6.  Differences in B6 levels could thenexplain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin Cchallenge(this is not the preferred route of catabolism).  Increasing yourintake of B6 would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if youtake vitamin C supplements.  Since the typical American diet is deficientin B6, some researchers believe that the main cause of calcium-oxalatekidney stones is B6 deficiency(especially since so little oxalic acid getsabsorbed from the gut).  Diets providing 0 to 130mg of oxalic acid per dayshowed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate(Urol Int.35:30-15,1980).  If 400mg was present each day, there was a significant increasein urinary oxalate excretion\tHere are the high oxalate foods\t1. Beans, coca, instant coffee, parsley, rhubarb, spinach and tea\t   Contain at least 25mg/100gram\t2. Beet tops, carrots, celery, chocolate, cumber, grapefruit, kale,\t   peanuts, pepper, sweet potatoe\t   Contain 10 to 25 mg/100gramsIf the threshold is 130mg per day, you can see that you really have a lotof latitude in food selection.  A recent N.Eng.J. Med. article also pointsout that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase yourintake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from beingabsorbed at all.  If you also increase your intake of B6, you shouldn'thave to worry about kidney stones at all. The RDA for B6 is 2mg per day formales and 1.6mg per day for females(directly related to protein intake)B6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if it is consumed in doses of 500mg or moreper day for an extended peroid(weeks to months). The USDA food survey done in 1986 had an average intake of 1.87 mg per dayfor males and 1.16mg per day for females living in the U.S.  Coupled withthis low intake was a high protein diet(which greatly increases the B6requirement), as well as the presence of some of the 40 different drugs thateither block B6 absorption, are metabolic antagonists of B6, or promote B6excretion in the urine.  Common ones are: birth control pills, alcoholisoniazid, penicillamine, and corticosteroids.  I tell my students tosupplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs thatincrease the B6 requirement.  The dose recommended for patients takingbirth control pills is 10-15mg per day and this should work for most of theother drugs that increase the B6 requirement(this would be on top of yourdietary intake of B6).  Any patient that has a history of kidney stoneformation should be given B6 supplementsOne other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure yourCa/Mg dietary ratio is 2/1.  Magnesium-oxalate is much more soluble than iscalcium-oxalate\t4. "The magnesium:calcium ratio in the concentrated urines ofpatients with calcium oxalate calculi"Invest. Urol 10:147(1972\t5. "Effect of magnesium citrate and magnesium oxide on thecrystallization of calcium in urine: changes producted by food-magnesiuminteraction"J. Urol. 143(2):248-51(1990)\t6.Review Article, "Magnesium in the physiopathology and treatmentof renal calcium stones" J. Presse Med. 161(1):25-27(1987)There are actually about three times as many articles published in themedical literature on the role of magnesium in preventing kidney stoneformation than there are for B6.  I thought that I was being pretty safe instating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation in an earlierpost in this news group but good old John A. in Mass. jumped all over me. Iguess that he doesn't read the medical literature.  Oh well, since kidneystones can be a real pain and a lot of people suffer from them, I thoughtI'd tell you how you can avoid the pain and stay out of the doctor's officeMartin Banschbach, Ph.DProfessor of Biochemistry and ChairmaDepartment of Biochemistry and MicrobiologOSU College of Osteopathic Medicin1111 W. 17th StreeTulsa, Ok. 7410"Without discourse, there is no remembering, without remembering, there isno learning, without learning, there is only ignorance".

Okay, this is a long shotMy friend Robin has recurring bouts of mononucleosis-type symptoms, very regularly.  This has been going on for a number of years.  She's seen a number of doctors; six was the last count, I think.  Most of them have said either "You have mono" or "You\'re full of it; there\'s nothing wrong with you."  One has admitted to having no idea what was wrong with her, and one has claimed that it is Epstein-Barr syndromeNow, what she told me about EBS is that very few doctors even believe that it exists.  (Obviously, this has been her experience.)  So, what's the story?  Is it real?  Does the medical profession believe it to be realHas anyone had success is treating EBS?  Or is it just something to live with?  Thanks for your assistanceJoel "The Ogre" Chernejcherney@reed.edOf the Hord

Thanks for your assistanceOutbreaks of a chronic-mono-like entity were originally called EBS (osome variant thereof) because most of the people with this disease haelevated levels of antibodies to the EBV virus. But not all of thedid, which prompted an official renaming of the disease to ChroniFatigue Syndrome (this renaming took place in the Annals of InternaMedicine, Jan. 1988, I believe). Now it's also called Chronic Fatiguand Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS), since it seems clear thasome sort of immune disregulation is causing the probsAstonishly, there are still docs who tell people with massivelswollen glands, recurrent fevers and nightsweats, etc., that there'nothing wrong with them. This is not the same thing as saying that thsyndrome may have a (at least partly) psychological cause. Thdisagreement among people whose thoughts are worth considering centeron just what the cause is. No one knows, but theories includepsychological stress, some sort of virus (a retrovirus, say most -maybe one of the newly discovered herpes viruses), environmentatoxins, bacteria (and, yes, candida), genes, (and/)or some combo otheseThere's no outright cure at the moment, but different docs trdifferent things, some of which seem to helpMassive amounts of info on the condition are available these daysPost your Q to alt.med.cfs, and you will be flooded w/factsNote: There are lots of far better understood (and better treatablediseases that look like CFIDS.

Prescribing controlled substances to patients with no\t   demonstrated need(other than a drug addition) for the medication\t2. Prescribing thyroid preps for patients with normal thyroid\t   function for the purpose of quick weight loss\t3. Using laetril to treat cancer patients when such treatment has\t   been shown to be ineffective and dangerous(cyanide release) by\t   the NCIThese are errors of commission that competently trained physicians shouldnot committ but sometimes do.  There are also errors of omission(some ofwhich result in malpractice suits).  I don't think that using anti-fungalagents to try to relieve discomfort in a patient who you suspect may behaving a problem with candida(or another fungal growth) is an error ofcommission or omission.  Healers have had a long history of trying torelieve human suffering.  Some have stuck to standard, approved proceduresothers have been willing to try any reasonable treatment if there is achance that it will help the patient.  The key has to be tied to thehealer\'s oath, "I will do no harm".  But you know David that very fewtreatments involve no risk to the patient.  The job of the physician is avery difficult one when risk versus benefit has to be weighed.  Eachphysician deals with this risk/benefit paradox a little differently.  Someare very conservative while others are more agressive.  An agressiveapproach may be more costly to the patient and carry more risk but as longas the motive is improving the patient's health and not an attempt to rakein lots of money(through some of the schemes that have been uncovered inthe medicare fraud cases), I don't see the need to label these healers asquacks or even unethicalWhat do I reserve the term quack for?  Pseudo-medical professionals. These people lurk on the fringes of the health care system waiting for thefrustrated patient to fall into their lair.  Some of these individuals arereally doing a pretty good job of providing "alternative" medicine.  Butmany lack any formal training and are in the "business" simply to make afew fast bucks.   While a patient can be reasonably assured of gettingcompetent care when a liscenced physician is consulted, this alternativecare area is really a buyer's beware arena.  If you are lucky, you may findsomeone who can help you.  If you are unlucky, you can loose a lot ofmoney and develop severe disease because of the inability of these pseudomedical professional to diagnose disease(which is the fortay of theliscened physicians)I hope that this clears things up DavidMarty B

At that time hesaw a gastroenterologist and has tried acid controllers (Mylanta,Tagamet), as well as a restricted diet and raising the head of his bed. These treatments were not effective and because the damage wasworsening, he opted for a surgical repair 3 months ago.  He was toldthere were two repair techniques that could fix the problem; a Nissenwrap and a "Hill Repair".  He opted for the "Hill Repair". He recoveredvery well from the surgery itself but the pain he had originally is worseand in addition he now has trouble swallowing (including saliva)The doctor now wants to do an endoscopy and has also informed himthat a biopsy might be necessary if he has a pre-cancerous conditionwhich he called "Barrett\'s Syndrome". If he can\'t avoid having reflux willhe necessarily get cancerBasically, if anyone has any information on what he should do now, I'dappreciate itThanksPat Lydon/ NetManage, Inc./ Pat@netmanage.co

As I recall, its been done to some experimental miceThey showed various ill effects and eventually died.  The reason ithat deuterium does not have exactly the same reaction rates ahydrogen due to its extra mass (which causes lower velocity, Boltzmaconstant, mumble).  This throws various bits of body biochemistry ouof kilter, and you get sick and dieI've never heard of anyone being poisened this way, in or out of realife.  The process takes quite a while.  If anyone wants to write thibook, I would imagine you would have to1: Replace a significant fraction of the water in the body with heav   water2: Wait while normal breakdown and repair processes cause othe   molecules in the body to be synthesised using the deuteriumDuring this process the victim would gradually deteriorate aneventually die, but I imagine it would take weeks during which thpoisoner would have to ensure that a significant proportion of thwater the victim ingested was heavyYou would get such a mess of symptoms that the doctors would be botalarmed and confused.  Why should every organ in the body suddenlbegin to deteriorate?  If you can figure out how the poisoner gets thheavy water into the victim in a hospital then you could have a reastory hereCome to think of it, <2> would continue even after the heavy water wano longer being ingested, so hospitalisation might be too lateThe most detectable effect would be that the victim's body fluidwould literally be "heavy".  Water has a molecular weight of 18 anheavy water has a MW of 20.  Thus the victim's weight will increase babout 1% for every 10% of body water replaced by heavy water.  Maybthe detection occurs because some pathologist in the lab notices thathe victim's urine is strangely dense.

Where before yohad a pat of butter now you need a medium apple (probably microwavcooked).  Smaller meals but more of them. Not terrific amounts of meat, it'hard to digest anyway.For comfort and to make the carbohydrate meal "last" longer eat pasta orice which give their calories up slowly rather than bread or corn. Maybsmaller meals as you may be getting less room in the stomach area. Is thbaby still coming up. Is it starting to push or rub under your ribs? Hotight are your clothes. You shouldn't be wearing any clothing that compressesyour middle. Be sure not to "suck in" your stomach when sitting, again iwill put pressure on the digestive tract.Try laying on your sides, backand stay in reclining positions for the many hours you are being inactiveEasier on your legs (circulation) as well. You might try letting the bab"turn" or at least not be forced under the ribs during the last monthsWhen you are shortwaisted it's easy for that baby to end up right under thdiaphram, especially if you have tight abdominal muscles. If I had msecond one to do over again I think I'd have tried to loosen up since hdidn't turn sideways until late and the relief was enormousMaybe this doctor does have a thing about weight gain in pregnancy or maybshe just nags all her patients this way. Especially if she's young.But this gallbladder/whatever problem that might be coming up is somethinto be avoided if possible.Nausea, etc. can vary from person to person and with each pregnancy. Mfirst pregnancy was miserable. During the second I had very little troubleSome articles have said that women with nausea had a statistically bettechance of carrying their baby.

There are quacks who don't treat and quacks whtreat. One's that refuse to diagnose and ones that diagnose improperly.There are lucky quacks and unlucky quacks. Smart quacks and dumb ones.There are people ahead of their time, with unprobable or unproven theorieand rationals. There are ill-reasoned, absurd, theorists.Sometimes it's hard to tell who's who. Reading a book of ancient jokes it seems that doctors called other doctorquacks in Babylon.Arguments abound when there aren't any firm answers. Plenty of illnessearen't, or can't, be diagnosed or treated. But I think it's better to arguagainst the theory, as was originally done with postings on candida a montor so ago. Stating the facts usually works better than simply asserting aopinion about someone's competency. And you can't convince everybody.Sometimes a correct diagnositakes years for people: they don't run into a doctor who recognizes thdisease, they haven't developed something recognizable yet, or they havsomething that no one is going to recognize, because it hasn't beedescribed yet. Sometimes they get a cure, sometimes the illness wears outsometimes they stumble on an improper diagnosis with the right treatmentsometimes they find it's incurable. There is no profit in a patient accepting a hopeless attitude about anillness. Unless it's a rock solid diagnosis of terminal disease it's imore like ly that a person will find a cure if they keep looking.-Jackie

Noring has pointed outhe catch-22 that if the "crazy" theory were true, you probably couldn\'find any direct evidence of it --- that you couldn't observe those yeastibeasties with present methods even if they were there.  Noring and thfellow from Oklahoma (sorry, forgot your name) have also suggested one seof anecdotal evidence in favor based on their personal experiences --namely, that when people with certain conditions are given anti-fungalsmany of them appear to get better. So, if you have any evidence *against* the hypothesis --- for examplecontrolled double-blind studies showing that the anti-fungals don't do anbetter than sugar water --- then let's hear it.  If you don't, then what whave is anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side, and abjecdisbelief on the other.  In which case, please, there is no point in yellinback and forth at each other any longer since neither side has anconvincing evidence either positive or negative. And I understand that your abject disbelief is based on the existence opeople who may get famous or make money applying the diagnosis to everythinin sight, making wild claims with no evidence, and always refusing to dcontrolled studies.  But that has absolutely no bearing on the apparentlsincere experiences of the people on the net observing anti-fungals workinon themselves and other people in certain specific cases.  There are alsquacks who sell oral superoxide dismutase, in spite of the fact that it'completely broken down in the guts, but this doesn't change the genuinscientific knowledge about the role of superoxide dismutase in fightinoxidative damage.  Same thing.  Just cause there are candida quacks, thadoesn't establish evidence against the candida hypothesis.  If there's somother reason (besides the quacks), if only anecdotal, to think it could btrue, then that is what has to be considered, that is what the net peoplhave been talking aboutBut again, there is no point in arguing about it.  There is anecdotaevidence, and there is no convincing evidence, and there are also somcandida quacks out there, I hope everyone can agree on all of that.  Thusit appears to me the main question now is whether the proponents camarshall enough anecdotal evidence in a convincing and documented enougmanner to make a good case for carrying out a good controlled double-blinstudy of antifungals (or else, forget convincing anybody else to carry outhe test, just carry it out themselves!) --- and also, whether they caadequately define the patient population or symptoms on which such a studshould be carried out to provide a fair test of the hypothesisKe--

SREBRENICA'S DOCTOR RECOUNTS TOWN'S LIVING HEL    By Laura Pitte    TUZLA, Bosnia, Reuter - Neret Mujanovic was a pathologiswhen he trekked through the mountains to the besieged Muslitown of Srebrenica last August    But after treating 4,000 mangled victims of Bosnia's bloodwar, he considers himself a surgeon    ``Now I'm a surgeon with great experience although I have nlicense to practice. But if I operate on a person and he livenormally that's the greatest license a surgeon could have.'    Evacuated by the U.N. this week to his home town of Tuzlathe Muslim physician gave an eyewitness medical assessment othe horrors of the year-long Serb siege of Srebrenica and thsuffering of the thousands trapped there    ``I lived through hell together with the people oSrebrenica. All those who lived through this are the greatesheroes that humanity can produce,'' he told reporters    Mujanovic, 31, had practiced for two months as an assistanat a local hospital in Tuzla, but before going to Srebrenica hhad never performed a surgical operation on his own. Now he sayhe has performed major surgery 1,396 times, relying on books foguidance, amputating arms and legs 150 times, usually withouanesthetic, delivering 350 babies and performing four cesareasections    He worked 18-to-19-hour days, slept in the hospital for thfirst 10 weeks after his arrival last Aug. 5 and treated  4,00patients    He arrived after making the trek over mountains on foot froTuzla, 60 miles northwest of Srebrenica. About 50 other peoplcarried in supplies and 350 soldiers guided and protected hithrough guerrilla terrain, he said    His worst memory was of 10 days ago when seven Serb shelllanded within one minute in an area half the size of a footbalfield, killing 36 people immediately and wounding 102. Half othe dead were women and children    The people had come out for a rare day of sunshine and thchildren were playing soccer. ``There was no warning ... thblood flowed like a river in the street,'' he said    ``There were pieces of women all around and you could nopiece them together. One woman holding her two children in hehands was lying with them on the ground dead. They had nheads.'    Before Mujanovic arrived with his supplies conditions werdeplorable, he said. Many deaths could have been prevented hathe hospital had surgical tools, facilities and medicine    The six general practitioners who had been operating beforhe arrived had even less surgical experience than he did. ``Thedidn't know the basic principles for amputating limbs.'    Once he arrived the situation improved, he said, but bmid-September he had run out of supplies    ``Bandages were washed and boiled five times ... sometimethey were falling apart in my hands,'' he said. Doctors had nanesthetic and could not give patients alcohol to numb the paibecause it increased bleeding    ``People were completely conscious during amputations anstomach operations,'' he said. Blood transfusions werimpossible because they had no facilities to test blood types    ``I felt destroyed psychologically,'' Mujanovic said    The situation improved after Dec. 4, when a convoy arrivefrom the Belgian medical group Medecins Sans Frontieres    But Mujanovic said the military predicament worsened imid-December after Bosnian Serbs began a major offensive in thregion. ``Every day we had air strikes and shellings.'    Then the hunger set in    Between mid-December and mid-March, when U.S. planes begaair dropping food, between 20 and 30 people were dying every dafrom complications associated with malnutrition, he said    ``I know for sure that the air drop operation saved thpeople from massive death by hunger and starvation,'' he said    According to Mujanovic, around 5,000 people died iSrebrenica, 1,000 of them children, during a year of siege    Mujanovic plans to return to Srebrenica in three weeks aftevisiting his wife, who is ill in Tuzla    ``They say I'm a hero,'' he said. ``There were thousands opeople standing at the sides of the road, crying and waving wheI left. And I cried too.'--Sharon Machlis GartenberFramingham, MA  USe-mail: sharon@world.std.co

Putting aside our substantial differences, I'd like to ask the knowledgeablones to give feedback on this.  Let me explainOne of my family members last week was discovered to have a brain tumor aftehaving some difficulties with walking and writing (she is 64 years old)Otherwise, she is in fine health.  The discovery was made via CAT scansShe then had MRI scans done, where small cancerous areas were discoverein her lungs.  Biopsies showed it to be adenocarcinoma.  One spot iin the lungs, and another in the pneumothorax.  The oncologists believthe cancer started in the lungs and caused the brain tumor (she smokeuntil four years ago)Anyway, I'd like feedback as to what adenocarcinoma is, how it is differenfrom other cancers, how she will be treated (luckily the tumor is righbelow the skull and can be easily removed), and statistically what arthe chances for full remission/recoveryThanksJon Norin--Charter Member --->>>  INFJ ClubIf you're dying to know what INFJ means, be brave, e-mail me, I'll send info============================================================================| Jon Noring          | noring@netcom.com        |                          | JKN International   | IP    : 192.100.81.100   | FRED'S GOURMET CHOCOLATE | 1312 Carlton Place  | Phone : (510) 294-8153   | CHIPS - World's Best!    | Livermore, CA 94550 | V-Mail: (510) 417-4101   |                          ============================================================================Who are you?

Last year, I was totally surprised when my annual physical disclosed ainguinal hernia.  I couldn't remember doing anything that would havcaused it.  That is, I hadn't been lifting more than other people doand in fact probably somewhat less.  Eventually the thing became morpainful and I had the repair operationThis year I developed a pain on the other side.  This turned out to banother inguinal hernia.  So I go back to the hospital Monday foanother fun 8-) operationI don't know of anything I'm doing to cause this to happen.  I'm 3years old and I don't think I'm old enough for things to start fallinapart like this.  The surgeon who is doing the operation seems tsuspect a congenital weakness, but if so, why did it suddenly appeawhen I was 37 and not really as active as I was when I was youngerDoes anyone know how to prevent a hernia, other than not liftinanything?  It's rare that I lift more than my 16-month-old or a sacfull of groceries, and you may have noticed that your typical grocersack is fairly small these days.

It almost scored a perfect brain-dead 10     It  was  commissioned by some whiny consumers  group  calledFamilies USA      The  poll tells us that the majority of  Americans  believethat doctors make too much money     The  pollsters  also asked what a fair income would  be  forphysicians.  Those polled said, oh, about $80,000 a year would beOK     How generous.  How sporting.  How stupid     Why is this poll stupid?   Because it is based on resentmentand envy, two emotions that ran hot during the political campaignand are still simmering     You could conduct the same kind of poll about any group thatearns $100,000-plus and get the same results.  Since the majorityof Americans don't make those bucks,  they assume that those  whodo are stealing it from them     Maybe  the Berlin Wall came down,  but don't  kid  yourself. Karl Marx lives     It's also stupid because it didn't ask key  questions,  suchas:  Do  you  know how much education and training  it  takes  tobecome a physician     If those polled said no,  they didn't know, then they shouldhave  been disqualified.   If they gave the wrong  answers,  theyshould have been dropped.   What good are their views on how mucha doctor should earn if they don't know what it takes to become adoctor     Or maybe a question should have been phrased this way:  "Howmuch  should  a person earn if he or she must (a)  get  excellentgrades and a fine educational foundation in high school in  orderto (b) be accepted by a good college and spend four years  takingcourses heavy in math, physics, chemistry, and other lab work andmaintain a 3.5 average or better,  and (c) spend four more  yearsof  grinding study in medical school,  with the third and  fourthyears in clinical training,  working 80 to 100 hours a week,  and(d) spend another year as a low-pay,  hard-work intern,  and  (e)put  in  another  three to 10 years  of  post-graduate  training,depending  on  your specialty and (f) maybe wind up  $100,000  indebt  after  medical school and (g) then work an  average  of  60hours  a week,  with many family doctors putting in 70  hours  ormore until they retire or fall over?     As  you have probably guessed by now,  I  have  considerablymore  respect for doctors than does the law firm of  Clinton  andClinton,  and all the lawyers and insurance executives they  havecalled together to remake America's health care     Based  on what doctors contribute to society,  they are  farmore useful than the power-happy,  ego-tripping, program-spewing,social tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that isto health what Clinton's first budget is to frugality     But propaganda works.   And,  as the stupid poll  indicates,many Americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are  themajor cause of high medical costs     Of  course doctors are well-compensated.   They  should  be. Americans now live longer than ever.   But who is responsible forour longevity--lawyers,  Congress, or the guy flipping burgers ina McDonald's     And the doctors prolong our lives despite our having  becomea  nation  of  self-indulgent,   lard-butted,   TV-gaping   couchcabbages     Ah,  that  is not something you heard President  Clinton  orSuper  Spouse  talk  about during the  campaign  or  since.   Butinstead of trying to turn the medical profession into a  villain,they might have been more honest if they had said     "Let  us  talk  about medical care and one  of  the  biggestproblems we have.   That problem is you, my fellow American. Yes,you,  eating  too much and eating the wrong foods;  many  of  youguzzling  too  much hooch;  still puffing away at $2.50  a  pack;getting  your daily exercise by lumbering from the fridge to  themicrowave to the couch; doing dope and bringing crack babies intothe  world;  filling  the big city emergency rooms  with  gunshotvictims;  engaging  in unsafe sex and catching a  deadly  diseasewhile blaming the world for not finding an instant cure     "You  and  your habits,  not the  doctors,  are  the  singlebiggest  health  problem in this country.   If  anything,  it  isamazing that the docs keep you alive as long as they do     "In fact,  I don\'t understand how they can stand looking  atyour blubbery bods all day     "So as your president,  I call upon you to stop whining  andstart living cleanly.   Now I must go get myself a triple cheesygreasy with double fries.  Do as I say, not as I do.     But  for those who truly believe that doctors are  overpaid,there is another solution: Don't use them     That's right.   You don't feel well?   Then try one of thosespine poppers,  needle twirlers, or have Rev. Bubba lay his handsupon your head and declare you fit     Or  there is the do-it-yourself approach.   You  have  chestpains?   Then sit in front of a mirror,  make a slit here, a slitthere, and pop in a couple of valves     You're  going to have a kid?

Does anyone know of research done on the use of haldol in the elderly?  Doesshort-term use of the drug ever produce long-term side-effects aftethe use of the drug?  My grandmother recently had to be hospitalizeand was given large doses of haldol for several weeks.  Although thdrug has been terminated, she has changed from a perky, slightlsenile woman into a virtual vegetable who does not talk to anyonand who cannot even eat or brush her teeth without assistance.  Iseems incredible to me that such changes could take place in thcourse of just one and one-half months.  I have to believe that thcombination of the hospital stay and some drug(s) are in parcatalysts for this.  Any comments--Will Estes\t\tInternet: westes@netcom.co

Anesthetic agentcan cause confusion because the body cannot clear the medicines out othe body as easily.  In addition, medications and interactions betweemedications can cause confusionAs far as whether or not haldol can have long lasting effects even aftethe drug has been discontinued, I do not know.  I have not _seen_ anythinto that effect.  However, I also had not been looking for that informationI can see what I can find..I can tell you that haldol is an antipsychotic drug, and, according tthe Nursing93 Drug handbook, it is "Especially useful for agitatioassociated with senile dementia"  (p. 400).  It also should not bediscontinued abruptly.  It did not say anything about long lastineffectsBecause so many things can cause confusion, it is hard for me to knowhat else was going on at the time; if I had more history, i might be ablto answer you better.

Eveyoung people find the change unsettlingThough we have thought that this decrement in function after - say anaesthesia and surgery for a fractured hip (a common event in thelderly) was due to anaesthesia there is good evidence that thchange of situation is much more important.

The selection othe anaesthetic has no effect on the ability to discharge thespatients earlyAnaesthetists who work with the elderly (which is almost all of usgenerally take care to tailor the choice and dose of drugs used tthe individual patient.

I've seen people in their forties and fifties become disoriented andemented during hospital stays. In the examples I've seen, drugs werdefinitely involved.My own father turned into a vegetable for a short time while in thhospital. He was fifty-three at the time, and he was on 21 separatmedications. The family protested, but the doctors were adamant, tellinus that none of the drugs interact. They even took the attitude that, ihe was disoriented, they should put him on something else as well! Witthe help of an MD friend of the family, we had all his medicatiodiscontinued. He had a seizure that night, and was put back on one drugTwo days later, he was his old self again. I guess there aren't manmedical texts that address the subject of 21-way interactionsI don't mean this as a cheap shot at the medical profession. It is aaspect of hospitals that is very frightening to me. Docs seem to believthat, because they have close control of you, it's quite all right ttake your bodily equilibria into their own hands. That control reducethe chance that the patient will make a mistake, but health carproviders can make mistakes too, and mistakes can be deadly under thoscircumstances.I grant you that sometimes there's no choice. Nevertheless, I suggesyou procure a list of the drugs your grandmother is getting, and discusit with an independent doc. Her problems may not be the effect of HALDOat all.

The cesarean rate in the United States is the third highest among21 reporting countries, exceeded only by Brazil and Puerto Rico (1). Thisreport presents data on cesarean deliveries from CDC's National HospitalDischarge Survey (NHDS) for 1991 and compares these data with previous years.     Data on discharges from short-stay, nonfederal hospitals have beencollected annually since 1965 in the NHDS, conducted by CDC's National Centerfor Health Statistics. For 1991, medical and demographic information wereabstracted from a sample of 274,000 inpatients discharged from 484participating hospitals. The 1991 cesareans and vaginal births after a priorcesarean (VBAC) presented in this report are based on weighted nationalestimates from the NHDS sample of approximately 31,000 (11%) women dischargedafter delivery. The estimated numbers of live births by type of delivery werecalculated by applying cesarean rates from the NHDS to live births fromnational vital registration data. Therefore, estimates of the number ofcesareans in this report will not agree with previously published data basedsolely on the NHDS (2). Stated differences in this analysis are significant atthe 95% confidence level, based on the two-tailed t-test with a critical valueof 1.96.     In 1991, there were 23.5 cesareans per 100 deliveries, the same rate asin 1990 and similar to rates during 1986-1989 (Table 1). The primary cesareanrate (i.e., number of first cesareans per 100 deliveries to women who had noprevious cesareans) for 1986-1991 also was stable, ranging from 16.8 to 17.5.In 1991, the cesarean rate in the South was 27.6, significantly (p<0.05)higher than the rates for the West (19.8), Midwest (21.8), and Northeast(22.6). Rates were higher for mothers aged greater than or equal to 30 yearsthan for younger women; in proprietary hospitals than in nonprofit orgovernment hospitals; in hospitals with fewer than 300 beds than in largerhospitals; and for deliveries for which Blue Cross/Blue Shield * and otherprivate insurance is the expected source of payment than for other sources ofpayment (Table 2). The same pattern characterized primary cesarean deliveries.     Since the early 1970s, the number and percentage of births to older womenincreased; however, if the age distribution of mothers in 1991 had remainedthe same as in 1986, the overall cesarean rate in 1991 would have been 23.3,essentially the same as the 23.5 observed.     Based on the NHDS, of the approximately 4,111,000 live births in 1991, anHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 199estimated 966,000 (23.5%) were by cesarean delivery. Of these, an estimated338,000 (35.0%) births were repeat cesareans, and 628,000 (65.0%) were primarycesareans. Since 1986, approximately 600,000 primary cesareans have beenperformed annually. In 1986, 8.5% of women who had a previous cesareandelivered vaginally, compared with 24.2% in 1991. Of all cesareans in 1991,35.0% were associated with a previous cesarean, 30.4% with dystocia (i.e.,failure of labor to progress), 11.7% with breech presentation, 9.2% with fetaldistress, and 13.7% with all other specified complications.     The average hospital stay for all deliveries in 1991 was 2.8 days. Incomparison, the hospital stay for a primary cesarean delivery was 4.5 days,and for a repeat cesarean, 4.2 days -- nearly twice the duration for VBACdeliveries (2.2 days) or for vaginal deliveries that were not VBACs (2.3days). In 1986, the average hospital stay for all deliveries was 3.2 days, forprimary cesareans 5.2 days, for repeat cesareans 4.7 days, and for VBAC andnon-VBAC vaginal deliveries 2.7 and 2.6 days, respectively.Reported by: Office of Vital and Health Statistics Systems, National Centerfor Health Statistics, CDC.Editorial Note: The cesarean rate in the United States steadily increased from1965 through 1986; however, the findings in this report indicate that rateshave been stable since 1986 (3). Because there is little evidence thatmaternal and child health status has improved during this time and becausecesareans are associated with an increased risk for complications ofchildbirth, a national health objective for the year 2000 (4) is to reduce theoverall cesarean rate to 15 or fewer per 100 deliveries and the primarycesarean rate to 12 or fewer per 100 deliveries (objective 14.8).     Postpartum complications -- including urinary tract and wound infections-- may account in part for the longer hospital stays for cesarean deliveriesthan for vaginal births (5). Moreover, the prolonged hospital stays forcesarean deliveries substantially increase health-care costs. For example, in1991, the average costs for cesarean and vaginal deliveries were $7826 and$4720, respectively. The additional cost for each cesarean delivery includes$611 for physician fees and $2495 for hospital charges (6). If the cesareanrate in 1991 had been 15 (the year 2000 objective) instead of 23.5, the numberof cesarean births would have decreased by 349,000 (617,000 versus 966,000),resulting in a savings of more than $1 billion in physician fees and hospitalcharges.     Despite the steady increase in VBAC rates since 1986, several factors mayimpede progress toward the year 2000 national health objectives for cesareandelivery. For example, VBAC rates substantially reflect the number of womenoffered trial of labor, which has been increasingly encouraged since 1982 (7).Of women who are offered a trial of labor, 50%-70% could deliver vaginally (7)--a level already achieved by many hospitals (8). Trial of labor was routinelyoffered in 46% of hospitals surveyed in 1984 (the most recent year for whichHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 199national data are available) (9) when the VBAC rate (according to NHDS data)was 5.7%. The year 2000 objective specifies a VBAC rate of 35%, based on allwomen who had a prior cesarean, regardless of whether a trial of labor wasattempted. To reach the overall cesarean rate goal, however, increases in theVBAC rate will need to be combined with a substantial reduction in the primaryrate.     One hospital succeeded in reducing the rate of cesarean delivery byapplying objective criteria for the four most common indications for cesareandelivery, by requiring a second opinion, and by instituting a peer-reviewprocess (10). Other recommendations for decreasing cesarean delivery ratesinclude eliminating incentives for physicians and hospitals by equalizingreimbursement for vaginal and cesarean deliveries; public dissemination ofphysician- and hospital-specific cesarean delivery rates to increase publicawareness of differences in practices; and addressing malpractice concerns,which may be an important factor in maintaining the high rates of cesareandelivery (4).Reference1.

During May 1992, the Office of Medical Services, Department ofState (OMS/DOS), and CDC were notified of an increased number of malaria casesamong official U.S. personnel stationed in Kampala, Uganda. A review of thehealth records from the Embassy Health Unit (EHU) in Kampala indicated that 27cases of malaria were diagnosed in official personnel from March through June1992 compared with two cases during the same period in 1991. EHU, OMS/DOS, andCDC conducted an investigation to confirm all reported malaria cases andidentify potential risk factors for malaria among U.S. Embassy personnel. Thisreport summarizes the results of the investigation.     Malaria blood smears from 25 of the 27 reported case-patients wereavailable for review by OMS/DOS and CDC. A case of malaria was confirmed ifthe slide was positive for Plasmodium sp. Of the 25 persons, 17 were slideconfirmed as having malaria.     A questionnaire was distributed to all persons served by the EHU toobtain information about residence, activities, use of malariachemoprophylaxis, and use of personal protection measures (i.e., using bednetsand insect repellents, having window and door screens, and wearing longsleeves and pants in the evening). Of the 157 persons eligible for the survey,128 (82%) responded.     Risk for malaria was not associated with sex or location of residence inKampala. Although the risk for malaria was higher among children aged lessthan or equal to 15 years (6/32 19%) than among persons greater than 15years (11/94 12%), this difference was not significant (relative riskRR=1.6; 95% confidence interval CI=0.6-4.0). Eighty-two percent of thecases occurred among persons who had been living in Kampala for 1-5 years,compared with those living there less than 1 year. Travel outside of theKampala area to more rural settings was not associated with increased risk formalaria.     Four malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens were used by persons whoparticipated in the survey: mefloquine, chloroquine and proguanil, chloroquinealone, and proguanil alone. In addition, 23 (18%) persons who responded werenot using any malaria chemoprophylaxis. The risk for malaria was significantlylower among persons using either mefloquine or chloroquine and proguanil (8/889%) than among persons using the other regimens or no prophylaxis (9/3724%) (RR=0.4; 95% CI=0.2-0.9). Twelve persons not using prophylaxis reportedside effects or fear of possible side effects as a reason.     The risk for malaria was lower among persons who reported using bednetsHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 199all or most of the time (2/27 7%) than among persons who sometimes or rarelyused bednets (15/99 15%) (RR=0.5; 95% CI=0.1-2.0). The risk for malaria wasalso lower among persons who consistently used insect repellent in the evening(0/16), compared with those who rarely used repellent (17/110 15%) (RR=0;upper 95% confidence limit=1.2). Risk for malaria was not associated withfailure to have window or door screens or wear long sleeves or pants in theevening.     As a result of this investigation, EHU staff reviewed with all personnelthe need to use and comply with the recommended malaria chemoprophylaxisregimens. EHU staff also emphasized the need to use personal protectionmeasures and made plans to obtain insecticide-impregnated bednets and toprovide window and door screens for all personnel.Reported by: U.S. Embassy Health Unit, Kampala, Uganda; Office of MedicalSvcs, Dept of State, Washington, D.C. Malaria Br, Div of Parasitic Diseases,National Center for Infectious Diseases, CDC.Editorial Note: In Uganda, the increase in malaria among U.S. personnel wasattributed to poor adherence to both recommended malaria chemoprophylaxisregimens and use of personal protection measures during a period of increasedmalaria transmission and intensified chloroquine resistance in sub-SaharanAfrica. The findings in this report underscore the need to provide initial andcontinued counseling regarding malaria prevention for persons living abroad inmalaria-endemic areas -- preventive measures that are also important forshort-term travelers to such areas.     Mefloquine is an effective prophylaxis regimen in Africa and in mostother areas with chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum; however, in some areas(e.g., Thailand), resistance to mefloquine may limit its effectiveness. InAfrica, the efficacy of mefloquine, compared with chloroquine alone, inpreventing infection with P. falciparum is 92% (1 ). Mefloquine is safe andwell tolerated when given at 250 mg per week over a 2-year period. The riskfor serious adverse reactions possibly associated with mefloquine prophylaxis(e.g., psychosis and convulsions) is low (i.e., 1.3-1.9 episodes per 100,000users 2), while the risk for less severe adverse reactions (e.g., dizziness,gastrointestinal complaints, and sleep disturbances) is similar to that forother antimalarial chemoprophylactics (1).     Doxycycline has similar prophylactic efficacy to mefloquine, but the needfor daily dosing may reduce compliance with and effectiveness of this regimen(3,4). Chloroquine alone is not effective as prophylaxis in areas of intensechloroquine resistance (e.g., Southeast Asia and Africa). In Africa, forpersons who cannot take mefloquine or doxycycline, chloroquine and proguanilis an alternative, although less effective, regimen. Chloroquine should beused for malaria prevention in areas only where chloroquine-resistant P.falciparum has not been reported.

Vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, andpertussis during infancy and childhood have been administered routinely in theUnited States since the late 1940s and has been associated with a greater than90% reduction in morbidity and mortality associated with infection by theseorganisms. Because of the increasing number of vaccines now routinelyrecommended for infants, a high priority is the development of combinedvaccines that allow simultaneous administration with fewer separateinjections.     The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently licensed two new productsfor vaccinating children against these diseases: 1) the Haemophilus bconjugate vaccine (tetanus toxoid conjugate, ActHIB Trademark), * forvaccination against Hib disease only and 2) a combined diphtheria and tetanustoxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) and Hib conjugate vaccine(TETRAMUNE Trademark), a combination of vaccines formulated for use invaccinating children against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and Hib disease.                               ActHIB Trademark     On March 30, 1993, the FDA approved a new Haemophilus b conjugatevaccine, polyribosylribitol phosphate-tetanus toxoid conjugate (PRP-T),manufactured by Pasteur Merieux Serum et Vaccins and distributed as ActHIBTrademark by Connaught Laboratories, Inc. (Swiftwater, Pennsylvania). Thisvaccine has been licensed for use in infants in a three-dose primaryvaccination series administered at ages 2, 4, and 6 months. Previouslyunvaccinated infants 7-11 months of age should receive two doses 2 monthsapart. Previously unvaccinated children 12-14 months of age should receive onedose. A booster dose administered at 15 months of age is recommended for allchildren. Previously unvaccinated children 15-59 months of age should receivea single dose and do not require a booster. More than 90% of infants receivinga primary vaccination series of ActHIB Trademark (consecutive doses at 2, 4,and 6 months of age) develop a geometric mean titer of anti-Haemophilus bpolysaccharide antibody greater than 1 ug/mL (4). This response is similar tothat of infants who receive recommended series of previously licensedHaemophilus b conjugate vaccines for which efficacy has been demonstrated inprospective trials. Two U.S. efficacy trials of PRP-T were terminated earlybecause of the concomitant licensure of other Haemophilus b conjugate vaccinesHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 199for use in infants (4). In these studies, no cases of invasive Hib diseasewere detected in approximately 6000 infants vaccinated with PRP-T. These andother studies suggest that the efficacy of PRP-T vaccine will be similar tothat of the other licensed Hib vaccines. TETRAMUNE Trademark     On March 30, 1993, the FDA approved a combined diphtheria and tetanustoxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) and Haemophilus b conjugatevaccine. TETRAMUNE Trademark, available from Lederle-Praxis Biologicals (PearlRiver, New York), combines two previously licensed products, DTP (TRIIMMUNOLRegistered, manufactured by Lederle Laboratories Pearl River, New York) andHaemophilus b conjugate vaccine (HibTITER Registered, manufactured by PraxisBiologics, Inc. Rochester, New York).     This vaccine has been licensed for use in children aged 2 months-5 yearsfor protection against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and Hib disease whenindications for vaccination with DTP vaccine and Haemophilus b conjugatevaccine coincide. Based on demonstration of co mparable or higher antibodyresponses to each of the components of the two vaccines, TETRAMUNE Trademarkis expected to provide protection against Hib, as well as diphtheria, tetanus,and pertussis, equivalent to that of already licensed formulations of otherDTP and Haemophilus b vaccines.     The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends thatall infants receive a primary series of one of the licensed Haemophilus bconjugate vaccines beginning at 2 months of age and a booster dose at age 1215 months (5). The ACIP also recommends that all infants receive a four-doseprimary series of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine at 2,4, 6, and 15-18 months of age, and a booster dose at 4-6 years (6-8). Acomplete statement regarding recommendations for use of ActHIB Trademark andTETRAMUNE Trademark is being developed.Reported by: Office of Vaccines Research and Review, Center for BiologicsEvaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration.

The workshop was organized by Dr. John Greenspan and Dr. DeborahGreenspan of the Department of Stomatology, School of Dentistry, University ofCalifornia, San Francisco.  An international steering committee and scientificprogram committee provided guidance.     The conference drew more than 260 scientists from 39 countries, includingAsia, Africa, Europe, Central America, South America, as well as the UnitedStates and Canada.  Support tor the workshop was provided by the NationalInstitute of Dental Research, the National Cancer Institute, the NationalInstitute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the NIH Office of AIDS Research,and the Procter and Gamble Company.     Among the topics discussed were: the epidemiology of HIV lesions; ethics,professional responsibility, and public policy; occupational issues; provisionof oral care to the HIV-positive population; salivary HIV transmission andmucosal immunity; opportunistic infections; pediatric HIV infection; andwomen's issues.                                Recommendation     Recommendations emerged from the workshop to define the associationbetween the appearance of oral lesions and rate of progression of HIV, toestablish a universal terminology for HIV-associated oral lesions, to look formore effective treatments for oral manifestations, to expand molecular biologystudies to understand the relationship between HIV infection and common orallesions, and to study the effects of HIV therapy on oral lesions.                                 Epidemiolog     Since the First International Workshop on Oral Manifestations of HIVInfection was convened five years ago, the epidemiology of HIV infection hasHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 1Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 199radically changed.  In 1988, HIV infection was detected and reported largelyin homosexual and bisexual males, intravenous drug users, and hemophiliacs. Today, more HIV infection is seen in heterosexual males and females and inchildren and adolescents.     While the predominant impact of HIV infection has been felt in Africa, amajor increase in infection rate is being seen in Southeast Asia as well. Five hundred thousand cases have been reported to date in this region and moreare appearing all the time.     Researchers are continuing to document the epidemiology of oral lesionssuch as hairy leukoplakia and candidiasis.  They also are beginning to explorethe relationships between specific oral lesions and HIV disease progressionand prognosis.                            Social/political Issue     Discussion on the social and political implications of HIV infectionfocused on changing the public's attitude that AIDS is retribution forindiscriminate sexual behavior and drug use.  Speakers also addressed healthcare delivery for HIV-infected patients, and the need to educate the publicabout what AIDS is, and how it is acquired.                          Saliva and Salivary Gland     Conference speakers described transmission issues and the HIV-inhibitoryactivity of saliva, the strength of which varies among the different salivarysecretions.  Whole saliva has a greater inhibitory effect than submandibularsecretions, which in turn have a greater inhibitory effect than parotidsecretions.  Research has shown that at least two mechanisms are responsiblefor salivary inhibitory activity.  They attributed the HIV-inhibitory effectof saliva to the 1) aggregation/agglutination of HIV by saliva, which may bothpromote clearance of virus and prevent it reaching a target cell, and 2)direct effects on the virus or target cells.     Other topics discussed were the manifestation of salivary gland diseasein HIV-infected persons and current research on oral mucosal immunity.                               Pediatric Issue     Pediatric AIDS recently has emerged as an area of intense interest.  Withearly and accurate diagnosis and proper treatment, the life expectancy of HIVinfected children has tripled.  The prevention of transmission of HIV frommother to child may be possible in many cases, particularly if the mother'ssero-status is known prior to giving birth.

Recommendations made atthe workshop include the standardization of terminology, refinement ofdiagnostic markers, standardization of study design, and proper considerationof confounding variables resulting from periodontal therapy.                       Occupational and Treatment Issue     Occupational issues surrounding the treatment of HIV-infected individualsand treatment rendered by HIV-infected health care professionals still commandconsiderable attention.  Factors under consideration include the cost/benefitof HIV testing, patient-to-health care provider transmission of HIV infectionand the reverse, and the use of mainstream versus dedicated facilities for thetreatment of HIV-infected patients.     Conference participants anticipate that a third International Workshop onthe Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection will be held in five years or less.

Sullivan, M.D. "The effortto accelerate FDA review for these drugs has been a long-term commitment andindeed a hallmark of this administration."These rules establish procedures for the Food and Drug Administration toapprove a drug based on "surrogate endpoints" or markers. They apply when thedrug provides a meaningful benefit over currently available therapies. Suchendpoints would include laboratory tests or physical signs that do not inthemselves constitute a clinical effect but that are judged by qualifiedscientists to be likely to correspond to real benefits to the patient.Use of surrogate endpoints for measurement of drug efficacy permits approvalearlier than if traditional endpoints -- such as relief of disease symptoms orprevention of disability and death from the disease -- are used.The new rules provide for therapies to be approved as soon as safety andeffectiveness, based on surrogate endpoints, can be reasonably established.The drug's sponsor will be required to agree to continue or conductpostmarketing human studies to confirm that the drug's effect on the surrogateendpoint is an indicator of its clinical effectiveness.One new drug -- zalcitabine (also called ddC) -- was approved June 19, using amodel of this process, for treating the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, thecause of AIDS.Accelerated approval can also be used, if necessary, when FDA determines thata drug, judged to be effective for the treatment of a disease, can be usedsafely only under a restricted distribution plan."The new rules will help streamline the drug development and review processwithout sacrificing goad science and rigorous FDA oversight," said FDAcommissioner David A.

[NASDAQ: REGN] have discovered thatcertain naturally occurring substances known as neurotrophic factors canprevent the degeneration of light-sensing cells in the retina of the eye. Thedegeneration of these cells, known as photoreceptors, is a major cause ofvisual impairment     This research, published to in the December issue of the Proceedings ofthe National Academy of Science (PNAS), holds promise for people who may losetheir sight due to progressive retinal degeneration -- currently, no drugtreatment for retinal degeneration exists. It is estimated that 2.5 millionAmericans have severe vision loss due to age-related macular degeneration and100,000 Americans are affected by retinitis pigmentosus, a hereditary diseasethat causes blindness. In addition, each year more than 15,000 people undergosurgical procedures to repair retinal detachments and other retinal traumas.     The research was funded in part by the RP (Retinitis Pigmentosa)Foundation Fighting Blindness, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and the National EyeInstitute. It was conducted by Drs. Matthew M. LaVail, Kazuhiko Unoki, DouglasYasurnura, Michael T. Matthes and Roy H. Steinberg at UCSF, arld Dr. C;eorgeYancoooulos, Regeneron's Vice President for Discovery. Regeneron holds anexclusive license for this research from UCSF     In the research described in the PNAS , a light-damage model was used toassess the survival-promoting activity of a number of naturally occurringsubstances. Experimental rats were exposed to constant light for one week.Eyes that had not been treated with an effective factor lost most of theirphotoreceptor cells -- the rods and cones of the retina -- after lightexposure. Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Ciliary NeurotrophicFactor (CNTF) were particularly effective in this model without causingunwanted side effects; other factors such as Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) andInsulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1) were not effective in these experiments.     Discussing the research, Dr. Jesse M. Cedarbaum, Regeneron's Director ofClinical Research, said, "BDNF\'s ability to rescue neurons in the retina thathave been damaged by light exposure may hold promise for the treatment of agerelated macular degeneration, one of the leading causes of vision impairment,and for retinal detachment.

It is possible that BDNFcould play a role in rescuing those cells once the retina has been reattachedsurgically."     "Retinitis pigmentosa is a slowly progressing disease that causes theretina to degenerate over a period of years or even decades. Vision decreasesto a small tunnel of sight and can result in total blindness. It is our hopethat research on growth factors will provide a means to slow the progressionand preserve useful vision throughout life," stated Jeanette S. Felix, Ph.D.,Director of Science for the RP Foundation Fighting Blindness.     In addition to the work described , Regeneron is developing BDNF inconjunction with Aingen Inc. [NASDAQ:AMGN] as a possible treatment forperipheral neuropathies associated with diabetes and cancer chemotherapy,motor neuron diseases, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Byitself, Regeneron is testing CNTF in patients with arnyotrophic lateralsclerosis (commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease).

These findings, according toinvestigators at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland, haveserious implications for public health in both industrialized and developingcountries.     "This study demonstrates why we can develop coronary heart disease andhave higher blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels.  It shows also theimportance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase bodyweight, thereby leading to a whole host of other health problems in developingcountries and affluent nations as well," explains principal investigator Dr.William E. Connor, head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipidmetabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University.     Over the past 25 years Dr. Connor and his team have characterized thefood and nutrient intakes of the Tara humara Indians in Mexico, whilesimultaneously documenting various aspects of Tarahumara lipid metabolism. These native Mexicans number approximately 50,000 and reside in the SierraMadre Occidental Mountains in the state of Chihuahua.  The Tarahumaras havecoupled an agrarian diet to endurance racing.  Probably as a result, coronaryheart disease, which is so prevalent in Western industrialized nations, isvirtually non existent in their culture.  Loosely translated, the nameTarahumara means "fleet of foot," reflecting a tribal passion for betting on"kickball" races, in which participants run distances of 100 miles or morewhile kicking a machete-carved wooden ball     The typical Tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans, tortillas,and pinole, a drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold water,together with squash and gath ered fruits and vegetables.  The Tara humarasalso eat small amounts of game, fish, and eggs.  Their food containsapproximately 12 percent of total calories as fat of which the majority (69percent) is of vegetable origin.  Dietician Martha McMurry, a coinvestigatorin the study, describes their diet as simple and very rich in nutrients whilelow in cholesterol and fat     The Tarahumaras have average plasma cholesterol levels of 121 mg/ dL,low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels of 72 mg/dl, and high-densitylipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels of 32 to 42 mg/dl.  All of those valuesare in the good, low-risk range, according to the researchers.  Elevatedcholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels are considered risk factors for heartHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 2Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 199disease.  HDL-cholesterol is considered beneficial.  In previous studies theTarahumaras had been found to be at low risk for cardiac disease, althoughable to respond to high-cholesterol diets with elevations in total and LDLcholesterol.     Clinical Research Center dietitian McMurry and coinvestigator MariaTeresa Cerqueira established a metabolic unit in a Jesuit mission schoolbuilding near a community hospital in the small village of Sisoguichi.  Foodwas weighed, cooked, and fed to the study participants under theinvestigators' direct supervision, ensuring that subjects ate only foodstipulated by the research protocol.  Fasting blood was drawn twice weekly,and plasma samples were frozen and shipped to Dr. Connors laboratory forcholesterol, triglyceride, and lipoprotein analyses.  Regular measurementsincluded participant body weight, height, and triceps skin fold thickness. Thirteen Tarahumaras, five women and eight men, including one adolescent, werefed their native diet for 1 week, followed by 5 weeks of an "affluent" diet.     "In this study we went up to a concentration of dietary fat that was 40percent of total calories.  This is the prototype of the holiday diet thatmany Americans consume a diet high in fat, sugar, and cholesterol, low infiber," elaborates Dr. Conners. Such dietary characteristics are reflected inthe cholesterol-saturation index, or CSI, recently devised research dietitianSonja Conner working with Dr. Connor.  "The CSI is a single number thatincorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturated fat inthe diet.  CSI indicates the diet's potential to elevate the cholesterollevel, particularly the LDL," Dr. Connor explains.  The Tarahumaran dietaverages a very low CSI of 20; Dr. Connor\'s "affluent" diet used in the studyranks a CSI of 149.     The experimental design of this study reflects the importance ofestablishing baseline plasma lipid levels, typical of the native diet, beforeexposing subjects to the experimental diet.  The standard curve relatingdietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off, orplateau, for consumption of large amounts of fat.  Changes in dietary fatand/or cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma levels.  "Youmust have the baseline diet almost free of the variables you are going to putinto the experimental diet.  The Framingham study, for example, did notdiscriminate on the basis of diet between individuals who got heart diseasebecause the diet was already high in fat.  All subjects were already eating ona plateau," Dr. Connor says.     After 5 weeks of consuming the "affluent" diet, the subjects\' mean plasmacholesterol levels had in creased by 31 percent, primarily in the LDLfraction, which rose 39 percent.  HDL-cholesterol increased by 31 per cent,and LDL to HDL ratios changed therefore very little.  Plasma triglyceridelevels increased by 18 percent, and subjects averaged an 8-pound gain inweight.  According to Dr. Connor, lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon,yielding nearly the same results after 7 days of affluent diet as after 35days.HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 2Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 199     The increase in HDL carries broad dietary implications for industrializednations.  "We think HDL-cholesterol increased because we increased the amountof dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous Tarahumara metabolicstudy.  In that study we saw no change in HDL levels after raising the dietarycholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption. In the present study we increased fat intake to 40 percent of the totalcalories.  We reached the conclusion in the Tarahumara study that HDL reflectsthe amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietarycholesterol.  HDL must increase to help metabolize the fat, and it increasedquite a bit in this study," Dr. Connor explains     Low HDL in the Tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor ofcoronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts offat or cholesterol.  HDL remains an important predictor to Americans becauseof their usual high fat intake.     Dr. Connor recommends a diet for Americans that contains less than 20percent of total calories as fat, less than 100 mg of cholesterol, and a CSIaround 20, varying in accordance with caloric needs.  Such a diet is low inmeat and dairy fat, high in fiber.  Dr. Connor also comments on recentsuggestions that Americans adopt a "Mediterranean-style" diet.  "The originalMediterranean diet, in its pristine state, consisted of a very low intake offat and very few animal and dairy products.  We are already eating a lot ofmeat and dairy products.  Simply to continue that pattern while switching toolive oil is not going to help the situation."     The World Health Organization (WHO) is focusing much attention on theemergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societiesundergoing technological development.  Dr. Connor says that coronary heartdisease starts with a given society's elite, who typically eat a differentdiet than the average citizen.  "If the pattern of afluence increases, theentire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease,which places a termendous health care burden on a society.  WHO would like thedeveloping countries to prevent coronary heart disease, so they canconcentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on publichealth measures to improve general well-being, rather than paying forunnecessary, expensive medical technology," Dr. Connors says     "The overall implication of this study is that humans can readily movetheir plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a high-risk range within avery short time by an affluent, excessive diet.  The present rate of coronaryheart disease in the United States is 30 percent less than it was 20 yearsago, so a lot has been accomplished.  We are changing rapidly," he concludesHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 2Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 199:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::                             General Announcment:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::        Publications for Health Professionals Available from NCI (1/93Unless otherwise noted, the following materials are provided free of charge bycalling the NCI's Publication Ordering Service, 1-800-4-CANCER.

But doctors who know of an HIV-positive colleague  whohas not sought advice must inform the employing authority and the appropriateprofessional regulatory body.  The guidelines  also emphasize the significanceof notifying all patients on whom an invasive procedure has been done by aninfected health-care  worker.  A model letter to patients who have come intocontact  with such an individual is provided, along with suggestions for health officials on how to deal with the media.  In addition, a  U.K. advisorypanel on HIV infection in health-care workers has  been formed to providespecific occupational recommendations to  those treating such patients.==================================================================   "Properties of an HIV \'Vaccine\'" Nature (04/08/93) Vol. 362, No. 6420, P. 504  (Volvovitz, Franklin and Smith, Gale)     The questions raised by Moore et al. about recombinant gp160  envelopeglycoprotein precursor from HIV-1 produced by  MicroGeneSys are advantagesrather than disadvantages, write  Franklin Volvovitz and Gale Smith ofMicroGeneSys in Meriden,  Conn.  Moore et al. says that gp160 in a baculovirusexpression  system does not bind strongly to the CD4 receptor, and that this recombinant gp160 does not stimulate the same antibodies as the  HIV-1 virusdoes in natural infection.  But vaccination with  recombinant gp160 inpatients infected with HIV-1 broadens HIV-1  specific envelope-directed immuneresponses, including  crossreactive antibodies to gp160 epitopes and CD4 andCD8  cytotoxic T-cell responses.  Volvovitz and Smith claim that they  neverintended their gp160 molecule to be identical to the native protein.  Antibodyresponses against native HIV-1 proteins,  including the types described byMoore et al., exist in nearly  all AIDS patients but do not preventHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 4Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 199progression of HIV disease.  In addition, the binding of gp120 or gp120antibody complexes to  CD4 has been shown to interfere with antigen specificactivation  of CD4 cells and trigger programmed cell death in vitro, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV infection.  The absence of CD4binding by the MicroGeneSys gp160 vaccine may therefore be viewed as an addedsafety feature.  Phase I studies have  demonstrated stable CD4 counts,stimulation of cytotoxic T cells, and the suggestion of restoration of immunefunction.  Based on  these and other clinical results, MicroGeneSys gp160 waschosen  by researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden for the  firstphase III vaccine therapy studies, conclude Volvovitz and  Smith.==================================================================   "HIV-1 Infection: Breast Milk and HIV-1 Transmission" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol.341, No. 8850, P. 930  (Mok, Jacqueline)     There are still more questions than answers regarding  HIV-1-positivewomen breastfeeding their babies, writes  Jacqueline Mok of the Lancet.  Theanti-infective properties of  milk are well documented.  While the numbers ofleukocytes,  concentrations of lactoferrin and IgA, and lymphocyte mitogenic activity decline sharply during the first two to three months of  lactation tobarely detectable levels, lactoferrin and IgA then  increase from three totwelve months, with 90 percent of total  IgA in milk being secretory IgA. Breastfeeding protects infants  against gastrointestinal and respiratoryillnesses, in both  normal and uninfected children born to HIV-positivemothers.  The Italian National Registry of AIDS discovered that breastfed HIV1 infected children had a longer median incubation time (19 months) thanbottlefed infants (9.7 months).  Breastfed children also had a slowerprogression to AIDS.  There is no agreement on which  antibodies offerprotection against HIV-1 infection.  Studies of  the biological properties ofmilk from 15 HIV-1 infected women  showed the presence of IgG and IgAantibodies against envelope  glycoproteins, as well as IgA antibodies againstcore antigens.   Binding of HIV-1 to the CD4 receptor can be inhibited by ahuman  milk factor.  In the developing world, where infectious disease  andmalnutrition contribute significantly to infant mortality,  breast milk isstill the best food for infants, regardless of the mother's HIV status. Transmission might be restricted by  breastfeeding after colostrum and earlymilk have been expressed  and discarded.  The possibility remains that breastmilk could  protect the infant who is already infected with HIV at birth and may even delay progression to AIDS, concludes Mok.==================================================================   "Absence of HIV Transmission From an Infected Dentist to His Patients" Journalof the American Medical Association (04/14/93) Vol. 269,  No. 14, P. 1802 (Dickinson, Gordon M. et al.)     If universal precautions are practiced, the risk of HIV  transmissionfrom dentist to patient appears to be infinitesimal, write Gordon M. DickinsonHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 4Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 199et al. of the University of Miami  School of Medicine in Miami, Fla.  Theresearchers contacted all  patients treated by a dentist with AIDS andattempts were made to contact all patients for HIV testing.  Living patientswith newly detected HIV infection were interviewed, and DNA sequence  analysiswas performed to compare genetic relatedness of their  HIV to that of thedentist.  Death certificates were obtained for deceased patients, and themedical records of those with  diagnoses suggestive of HIV disease or drugabuse and those dying under the age of 50 years were examined in detail. There were  1,192 patients who had undergone 9,267 procedures, of whom 124 were deceased.  An examination of the death certificates of  patientsidentified five who had died with HIV infection, all of  whom were eitherhomosexuals or IV-drug users.  The researchers  were able to detect 962 of theremaining 1,048 patients, and 900  agreed to be tested.  HIV infection wasreported in five of the  900 patients, including four who had clear evidenceof risk  factors for the disease.  One patient who had only a single evaluation by the dentist denied high-risk behavior.  Comparative DNA sequenceanalysis showed that the viruses from the dentists  and these five patientswere not closely related.  The study  suggests the potential for HIVtransmission from a general  dentist to his patients is minimal in a settingin which  universal precautions are strictly observed, conclude Dickinson  etal.       ================================================================                                  April 22, 1993       ================================================================  "AIDS Patients are Susceptible to Recurrences of TB, Study Says" WashingtonPost (04/22/93), P. A13     Tuberculosis can strike AIDS patients more than once, which makes theresurging health hazard harder to control, according to a  study published intoday's New England Journal of Medicine.   People who contract TB usuallydevelop an immunity that protects  them if they are exposed to the bacteriaagain.  But a person  whose immune system is depleted may not be able to fightoff a  new TB infection, doctors found.  Peter M. Small of the Howard  HughesMedical Institute at Stanford University, director of the  study, said that inorder to protect against reinfection, it may  be necessary for some people touse TB medicines permanently.   The study examined the genetic makeup of TBbacteria and how the  germs changed over time in 17 patients at Kings CountyHospital  in New York.================================================================   "HIV-1 Infection: Breast Milk and HIV-1 Transmission" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol.341, No. 8850, P. 930  (Mok, Jacqueline)     There are still more questions than answers regarding  HIV-1-positivewomen breastfeeding their babies, writes  Jacqueline Mok of the Lancet.

In the Lancet's March 13 issue, Schechter et al. call Duesberg's hypothesis that injected and orally used recreational drugs and  AZT lead toAIDS, "a hindrance to public health initiatives."   However, their hypothesisthat HIV is the cause of AIDS has not  attained any public health benefits. The U.S. government spends  $4 billion annually, but no vaccine, no therapy,no prevention,  and no AIDS control have resulted from work on thishypothesis.   Schechter et al. conclude that HIV has a key role in CD4 depletion and AIDS based on epidemiological correlations with  antibodiesagainst HIV and with self reported recreational drug  use among homosexualsfrom Vancouver.  However, their survey  neglects to disprove Duesberg's drugAIDS hypothesis, because it  does not provide controls--i.e., confirmed drugfree AIDS  cases--and because it does not quantify drug use and ignores AZT use altogether.  To refute Duesberg's hypothesis Schechter would  have toproduce a controlled study demonstrating that over a  period of up to 10 yearsHIV-positive patients who use  recreational drugs or AZT or both have the sameAIDS risks as  positives who do not do so.  The 10 year period is claimed by HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 4Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 199proponents of the HIV hypothesis to be the time needed for HIV to cause AIDS. Alternatively, they could show that HIV-free  individuals who have used drugsfor 10 years never get  AIDS-defining illnesses, concludes Duesberg.================================================================  "Rapid Decline of CD4+ Cells After IFNa Treatment in HIV-1  Infection"Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 959   (Vento, Sandro et al.)     Interferon (IFN), which induces autoantibodies and autoimmune  diseasesin some settings, may hasten CD4 T-cell loss in some  HIV-1 infectedindividuals through the amplification of harmful  "autoimmune" reactions,write Sandro Vento et al. of the A.  Pugliese Hospital in Catanzaro, Italy. The researchers report  three asymptomatic HIV-1 infected individuals withhepatitis C  Virus related chronic active hepatitis (CAH) who had a rapid, profound decline of CD4 cells after IFN.  All three patients  throughout theobservation were consistently negative for serum  HIV p24 antigen and hadcirculating antibodies to p24.  Sera from all three patients, obtained at theend of IFN treatment and  testing in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay,contained high  titres of antibodies reacting to a sequence located in the aminoterminal of the beta chain of all human HLA class II  antigens,homologous to a sequence located in the carboxy  terminus of HIV-1 gp41. These autoantibodies, which also  recognize "native" class II molecules andmay contribute to the  elimination of CD4 T cells "in vivo", were at low tires(50-100)  in all three patients six months after stopping IFN.  Such autoantibodies were not detected in 28 other patients with HIV  infection andHCV related CAH treated with IFN and who did not  experience CD4 T-cell lossin some HIV-1 infected individuals  through the amplification of harmful"autoimmune" reactions.  The subjects had A1; B8; DR3; and B35, DR1 HLAantigen combinations  which are linked with a more rapid fall in CD4 cellcounts and  clinical progression of HIV-1 disease.  IFN can induce a very rapid decline of CD4 cells and should be used cautiously in  patients withthese HLA haplotypes, the researchers conclude.       ================================================================                                  April 23, 1993       ================================================================   "TB Makes a Comeback" State Government News (04/93) Vol. 36, No. 4, P. 6  (Voit, William and Knapp, Elaine S.)     Although tuberculosis was once believed to be eliminated in the  UnitedStates, it is emerging again among the homeless, AIDS  patients, immigrants,minorities, and prisoners.  Dr. Lee B.  Reichman, professor of medicine at theUniversity of New Jersey  Medical School and president of the American LungAssociation,  said, "Right now, it\'s a big city problem, but potentially it\'s everyone\'s problem."  The ALA predicts that 10 million Americans  are infectedwith TB, and about 10 percent of them will develop  the disease because theirimmune systems are depressed,  especially those with AIDS or HIV.

State health officials believe the TB is also  spreading becausethose who are most susceptible are the least  likely to follow through withtreatment.  In addition, the  increase is attributed to a shortage of publichealth services.   In New York City, TB is an epidemic "because the number ofcases  is increasing faster than we can treat people," said Dr. George Diferdinando, director of the New York State TB Control.   According toDiferdinando, curbing the spread of TB entails  keeping 85 percent or more ofdiagnosed TB cases in treatment.   About 40 percent of infected New York Cityresidents don't  complete therapy.  When TB patients don't finish taking their medication, multi-drug resistant TB can develop, which requires  taking moreexpensive drugs and can take two years instead of the normal six months totreat ================================================================    "Increasing Frequency of Heterosexually Transmitted AIDS in  SouthernFlorida: Artifact or Reality?" American Journal of Public Health (04/93) Vol.83, No. 4, P. 571  (Nwanyanwu, Okey C. et al.)     The alarmingly high rate of heterosexually acquired AIDS cases insouthern Florida was partially related to misclassification of  risk, writeOkey C. Nwanyanwu et al. of the Centers for Disease  Control in Atlanta, Ga. The researchers investigated 168 such  AIDS cases from Broward and coastalPalm Beach counties.  All of  these cases attributed to heterosexualtransmission reported  sexual contact with bisexual men, injecting drug users,or  persons born in countries where heterosexual contact is the  primary routeof HIV transmission.  Medical records of patients,  in addition to recordsfrom social services, HIV counseling and  testing centers, and sexuallytransmitted disease (STD) clinics  were reviewed.  If no other HIV risk factorwas found from  medical record review, patients were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire.  Once STD clinic and other medical  records werereviewed, 29 men and 7 women were reclassified into  other HIV transmissioncategories.  After adjustments were made  for the reclassification, thepercentage of AIDS cases reported  from Palm Beach and Broward countiesbetween January 1, 1989, and March 31, 1990, that was attributed toheterosexual transmission  decreased from 10 percent to 6 percent among menand from 33  percent to 28 percent among women.

Fordham)     The risk of HIV transmission from an HIV-positive surgeon to  patient isextremely low, provided that the surgeon strictly  adheres to universalinfection control procedures, write C.  Fordham von Reyn et al. of theDartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H.  The researchers contacted2,317 former patients on whom an HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon performedinvasive  procedures between January 1, 1978 and June 30, 1992.  The orthopedic surgeon voluntarily withdrew from practice after  testing positivefor HIV.  A total of 1,174 former patients  underwent HIV testing,representing 50.7 percent of patients on  whom the orthopedic surgeonperformed invasive procedures during  the 13.5-year period.  Patients weretested from each year and  from each category of invasive procedure.  Allpatients were  found to be negative for HIV by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay.  Two former patients reported known HIV infection prior to surgery. The examination of AIDS case registries and vital  records neglected to detectcases of HIV infection among former  surgical patients.  The estimated cost ofthe initial patient  notification and testing was $158,000, with the singlemost  expensive activity being counseling and testing.  This accounted  for 37percent of the total expense.  The patient notification  and testing wereconducted while maintaining the confidentiality  of the orthopedic surgeon whowas an active participant in the  planning and execution of the study. Notifying patients of the  infected surgeon's HIV-status is both disruptiveand expensive  and is not routinely recommended, the researchers conclude. \\       =================================================================    "Investigation of Potential HIV Transmission to the Patients of  an HIVInfected Surgeon" Journal of the American Medical Association (04/14/93) Vol.HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 3Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 199269,  No. 14, P. 1795  (Smith Rogers, Audrey et al.)     The risk of HIV transmission during surgery is so remote that it  will bequantified only by gathering data from multiple,  methodologically similarinvestigations, writes Audrey Smith  Rogers et al. of the Johns HopkinsUniversity School of Medicine  in Baltimore, Md.  The researchers identified atotal of 1,131  persons in hospital databases who underwent invasive surgical procedures between 1984 and 1990 and for whom the HIV-positive  surgeon waslisted as the operating surgeon.  The AIDS case  registries were reviewed forall patients having undergone  invasive procedures and death certificates wereobtained.  Among  the 1,131 patients, 101 were dead, 119 had no address, 413had  test results known, and 498 did not respond to the questionnaire. Nostudy patient name was found in reported AIDS case registries. One newlydetected, HIV-positive patient was determined to have  been most probablyinfected in 1985 during a transfusion.  There  was no HIV transmission in 369person-hours of surgical exposure, suggesting that HIV transmission topatients is unlikely to occur more frequently than once per 1000 person-hoursof surgical  exposure.  The researchers determined there is no evidence to suggest that the surgeon failed to adhere to standard  infection-controlguidelines; over 50 percent of the patients  with invasive procedures chose tobe tested, and of those whose  results were revealed, only one person wasfound to be infected  with HIV.  The study patient's infection was probablythe result  of a tainted blood transfusion received in 1985.  As a result, there is no evidence that the transmission of HIV from the  HIV-positivesurgeon to any patient transpired, the researchers  conclude.      =================================================================                                April 20, 1993      ================================================================= "Drug Concerns to Share AIDS Data" New York Times (04/20/93), P. C10 (Kolata, Gina)     A total of 15 major pharmaceutical companies have decided, in a  highlyunusual move, to share AIDS drugs and information while  the drugs areundergoing early clinical testing.  Dr. Edward  Scolnick, president of theMerck Research Laboratory in Rahway,  N.J., arranged the collaboration.  Hesaid that cooperation  between companies seemed increasingly significant as ithad  become clear that combinations of drugs were likely to be more  effectivein fighting HIV than any drug used alone.  The  researchers are hopeful thatHIV, when faced with a combination  of several drugs requiring mutation atdifferent sites for  resistance to develop, will be unable to evolve all themutations at the same time.  Therefore, several drugs taken together or oneafter the other could halt the spread of HIV.  Currently, the  drug companiesdo not know what other drugs their competitors are developing.  The newagreement allows companies to routinely  exchange animal data and safety dataon new AIDS drugs.  "An  agreement like this will greatly facilitateHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 3Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 199companies' ability to choose the best drug combinations much faster and in amuch more  efficient way," said Scolnick.  He also said that the collaboration would not violate antitrust laws.  In creating the  agreement,Merck spoke frequently to members of AIDS advocacy  groups, including ACT-UP. Dr. Daniel Hoth, director of the  division on AIDS at the National Instituteof Allergy and  Infectious Disease said, "We\'re delighted to see the pharmaceutical industry take this step because we think that  increasing theinformation flow will likely accelerate the  discovery of better compounds forAIDS."

AZT has been used in the United  States in asymptomatic HIV-positive people onthe basis that  administration of the drug appeared to abate the decline of T-cell counts.  However, a report in the Lancet demonstrated that AZT shouldnot be used early in the course of disease.  While the CD4 counts of the 877people given AZT were consistently greater  than those of patients receivingonly placebo, the first three  years of follow-up have shown that theproportions of people in  the two groups progressing to overt AIDS or even todeath were  not significantly different at roughly 18 percent.  The conclusions are that AZT is not an effective AIDS drug in  HIV-infectedindividuals, and that CD4 cell count may not be a  reliable proxy for theprogression to AIDS in infected people.   But nothing is implied by the studyof the utility of AZT in the  treatment of those in whom symptoms have alreadyappeared--there  is no case for abandoning that treatment, at least on the evidence now available.  It is much more alarming that the CD4  count hasproven to be an unreliable mark of the efficacy of drug treatment in HIVinfection.  AIDS researchers should acknowledge  HIV is alive from thebeginning of infection and turn it into a  workable assay of the progress ofdisease.  The general  application of such an assay will probably in itselfprovide a  better understanding of the pathogenesis of AIDS, concludes Maddox.      =================================================================="Infective and Anti-Infective Properties of Breastmilk From  HIV-1-InfectedWomen" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 914   (Van de Perre, Philippeet al.)     A vaccine preparation inducing a persistent immune response of  the IgMtype in the mother's body fluids could be valuable to  prevent transmission ofHIV-1 from mother to child, write  Philippe Van de Perre et al. of theHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 4Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 199National AIDS Control Program in Kigali, Rwanda.  The researchers hypothesizedthat  transmission of HIV-1 through breastmilk could be favored by the presence of infected cells, by deficiency of anti-infective  substances inbreastmilk, or both factors.  A total of 215  HIV-1-infected women wereenrolled at delivery in Kigali, Rwanda; milk samples were collected 15 days, 6months, and 18 months post partum.  HIV-1 IgG, secretory IgA, and IgM wereassayed by  western blot, for the latter two after removal of IgG with protein G.  In the 15-day and 6-month samples, the researchers  sought viralgenome in milk cells by double polymerase chain  reaction with three sets ofprimers (gag, pol, and env).  At 15  days, 6 months, and 18 months postpartum, HIV-1 specific IgG was detected in 95 percent, 98 percent, and 97percent of breastmilk  samples; IgA in 23 percent, 28 percent, and 41 percent;and IgM  in 66 percent, 78 percent, and 41 percent.  In children who  survivedlonger than 18 months the risk of infection was  associated with lack ofpersistence of IgM and IgA in their  mothers' milk.  The presence of HIV-1infected cells in the milk  15 days post partum was strongly predictive ofHIV-1 infection in the child by both univariate and multivariate analysis. The  combination of HIV-1 infected cells in breastmilk and a defective IgMresponse was the strongest predictor of infection.  IgM and  IgA anti-HIV-1 inbreastmilk may protect against postnatal  transmission of HIV, the researchersconclude.      ==================================================================                                   April 21, 1993      ==================================================================   "Firms to Share AIDS Research in Global Venture" Journal of Commerce(04/21/93), P. 7A     A total of fifteen U.S. and European pharmaceutical companies  announcedTuesday they will swap drug supplies and information on early-stage AIDSresearch to hasten the search for combination  therapies to fight HIVinfection and AIDS.  The companies said  the unusual move resulted primarilyfrom the increasing  concentration of AIDS research on combination therapiessince  realizing that HIV is likely to develop resistance to every  individualAIDS drug.  Edward Scolnick, president of Merck & Co.  Research Laboratories,led the collaborative effort that took a  year of negotiations to cometogether, said participants.  In  addition to Merck, the other companiesinvolved in the  Inter-Company Collaboration for AIDS Drug Development are Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Burroughs Wellcome, Glaxo Inc.,  Hoffman-La Roche,Eli Lilly & Co., Pfizer Inc., Smithkline  Beecham, AB Astra, Du Pont Merck,Syntex Inc., Boehringer  Ingelheim, Miles Inc., and Sigma-Tau.  Theparticipants said that all companies involved in AIDS drug development theywere aware  of had joined the collaboration, and that any company actively involved in HIV anti-viral development may participate.

This is to followup my previous reply on this topic, which it has beepointed out to me might have been dangerously misleading in two spots1.  I stated that psychotherapy (meaning talking therapy and so on) was used    to treat Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, which though sometimes true is    misleading.  It is not often found effective, particularly by itself    Primary treatment today usually consists at least in part of dru    therapy.  The most current theories of this condition attribute    it to more to biological causes than psychological, in places where thi    distinction becomes important2.  I mentioned that the DSM-IIIR mentions 'impulses' as a possible\tdiagnostic marker.  However, this might look like somethin\tpeople associate with psychotic conditions, uncontrollable o\tunpredictable behaviors, which is NOT the case with OCD. \tOne of the diagnostic criteria of OCD is that the individua\tcan and does suppress some of their 'impulses,' although the\tare an unending source of anxiety. \tThe obsessive thoughts and ritualistic actions usually associated with\tOCD are most frequently very mundane and predictable, closer t\ta superstitious nature than a dangerous nature for the most part\tSome references (one non-technical and several technical\tthat someone was kind enough to supply for m\tbut was unable to post themself |"The boy who couldn\'t stop washing" by judith rapaport.   **\t(technical refs) |\tpharmacotherapy of o-c disorde|\tdonna m jermain and lynn crismo|\tpharmacotherapy 1990; 10(3):175-19|\tepidemiology of oc|\tseteven a rasmussen and jane eise|\tj clin psychiatry 1990;51(2, suppl.):10-1|\tthe waking nightmare: an overview of oc|\tjudith l rapopor|\tj clin psychiatry 1990; 51(11, suppl.):25-2|\tabsence of placebo response in oc|\tmatig r mavissakalian, bruce jones, stephen olso|\tj nerv ment disease 1990 vol 178 no. \tAnd thanks very much to those who supplied constructive \tcriticism to my first post on OCD.

All the clamorover laetril resulted in the NCI spending quite a bit of money on clinicaltrials which proved(to me anyway) that laetril was ineffective againstcancer.  A physician who continued to use it, when better, more effective,treatments are available, may deserve to be called a quack.  Anti-fungalsare in a different class.  The big question seems to be is it reasonable touse them in patients with GI distress or sinus problems that *could* be dueto candida blooms following the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics?  GordenRubenfeld, through e-mail, has assured me that most physicians recognizethe chance of candida blooms occuring after broad-spectrum antibiotic useand they therefore reinnoculate their patients with *good* bacteria torestore competetion for candida in the body.  I do not believe that this isyet a standard part of medical practice.  He deals with critical carepatients where fungal infection(systemic) is a real problem and justbecause he tries to keep *good* bacteria in his patients does not mean thatall physicians do this.  I think that aspergillis is more likely to befound in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida.  Women have been knownfor a very long time to suffer from candida blooms in the vagina and awomen is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the cause andnot give give her advise to use the OTC anti-fungal creams.  Since candidacolonizes primarily in the ano-rectal area, GI symptoms should be more commonthan vaginal problems after broad-spectrum antibiotic useThe problem we have here David is proof that GI discomfort can be caused bya candida bloom.  The arguement is that without proof, no action iswarrentedMedicine has not, and probalby never will be, practiced this way.  Therehas always been the use of conventional wisdom.  A very good example iskidney stones.  Conventional wisdom(because clinical trails have not beendone to come up with an effective prevention), was that restricitng theintake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stonesfrom forming.  Clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts tobreakdown the stone once it formed.  Through the recent New England J ofMedicine article, we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong,increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than isrestricting calcium intakeThe conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need tobe reinnoculated with *good* bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapyIf it makes sense for livestock, why doesn't it make sense for humansDavid?  We are not talking about a dangerous treatment(unless you consideryogurt dangerous).  If this were a standard part of medical practice, asGordon R. says it is, then the incidence of GI distress and vaginal yeastinfections should declineMarty B

I have a fairly severe high frequency hearing loss. A recent rough tesshowed a gently sloping loss to 10-20db down at 1000cps. Then it falls ofa cliff to 70-80dbs down from 1500cps on.  This type of loss is difficulto fit. I am currently using some old siemens behind the ear aids whickeep me roughly functional, but leave a lot to be desiredRecently I had an opportunity to test the Widex Q8 behind the ear aids foseveral weeks. These have four independent programs which are intended tbe customized for different hearing situations and can be reprogramed. found them to be a definite improvement over my current aids and was abouto go ahead with them until another local outfit advertised a free trial oanother programmable system called ReSoundUnfortunately I was only able to try the ReSound aids in their office foabout 30 minutes and I couldn't compare them 'head to head' with the WidexNevertheless, it did appear to me that they were superior and I waimpressed by what I was able to read about the theory behind them which will give in a separate posting. They also carry the Widex aids and had onpatient (presumably wealthy) who decided to go ahead and get the ReSouneven though he had purchased the Widex only 6 months agoThe problem is that the ReSound aids are about twice as expensive as thWidex and other programmable aids. I could take a trip to Europe on thdifference!  Being a lover of bargains and hating to spend money, I ahaving a hard time persuading myself to go with the ReSounds.

The following is based on copies I was given of some articles published iHearing Instruments. I would appreciate any comments about this and othe'new' technology for hearing aidsThe ReSound system was developed on the basis of some research at AT&T anappears to take a different approach from other aids. It appears to me thaa new 'programmable' aid like the Widex just uses a more flexible (anprogrammable) version of the classical approach of amplifying some parts othe spectrum more than others and adding some compression to try and helout in 'noisy' situationsThe major difference in the ReSound approach is that it divides thspectrum into low and high frequencies (splitting point is programmable)apparently based on the fact that lots of vowel information can be found ithe low frequencies, while the important consonant informatio(unfortunately for me) is in the high frequencies. The two bands then artreated with different compression schemes which are programable. They havalso developed a new fitting algorythm that builds on what they cal'abnormal growth of loudness'This latter is interesting and fits my own personal experience, though think the phrase is missleading. What appears to be the case is that as yoexceed the minimum threshold for a person with hearing loss, the deficibecomes progresslively less compared to normals and by the time you reacthe 'too loud' point the sensitivity curves appear to converge.  This meanthat if you just boost all sound levels, you are overloading at the higend for people with hearing losses. Hence what you want is progressivelless amplification as the signal get closer to the maximum tolerable pointYou want to boost low volume sounds more than high and do so potentialldifferently for the low and high frequency parts of the spectrum (speciallfor someone like me who is relatively normal up to 1000 cps and then falloff a cliff)Aids with simple compressors don't descriminate between energy in the loand high frequencies and can therefor 'compress' useful high frequencinformation because of high volume of low frequency componentsParticularly impressive was the ReSound performance with whispered speecand in simulated restaurant noise situations.-Rich Haller <rhaller@ns.uoregon.edu>   University of Oregon, Eugene, ORUS

This question came up in Sci. Med. Nutrition and I'm posting my answerhere.  Only 22 medical schools in the U.S. teach courses on humannutrition.  We have already seen what a lack of nutrition education can dowhen candida and kidney stones present themselves to the medical communityI think that the best example of where U.S. medicine is really missing themark when it comes to a knowledge of nutrition is PMS.  So many women(andtheir husbands) suffer from this disorder that it is really criminal thatmost physicians in the U.S. are not taught that PMS is primarily caused bydiet and diet changes can prevent it from ever happpening.  Before shootingyour flames, read the entire article and then decide if flaming isjustifiedFrom A Poster In Sci. Medi. Nutrition> \tIn a psychological anthropology course I am taking, we got> sidetracked onto a short conversation about PMS.  Some rumors share> by several of the students included ideas that vitamin levels, suga> intake, and caffeine intake might affect PMS symptoms> \tIs there any data on this, or is it just so much hooey>> Many thanks>> Michael, I've wanted to reply to this post ever since I saw it but I gotside-tracked with candida.  PMS is a lot like Candida blooms, mostphysicians don\'t recognize it as a specific "disease" entity.  Here iseverything that you would ever want to know about PMSPremenstrual syndrome has been divided into four specific subgroups\tPMT-A(Anxiety)\t\tPMT-D(depression\tanxiety\t\t\tdepressio\tirritability\t\tforgetfulnes\tinsomnia\t\tconfusio\tdepression\t\tletharg\tPMT-C(Craving)\t\tPMT-H(Hyperhydration\tcraving for sweets\tweight gai\tincreased appetite\tbreast congestion and tendernes\tsugar ingestion causes: abdominal bloating and tendernes\t 1. headache\t\tedema of the face and extremitie\t 2. palpitation\t 3. fatigue or faintinPMT-A is characterized by elevated blood estrogen levels and lowprogesterone levels during the luteal phase of a women's cyclePMT-C is caused by the ingestion of large amounts of refined simplecarbohydrates.  During the luteal phase of a women's cycle, there isincreased glucose tolerance with a flat glucose curve after oral glucosechallenge.  The metabolic findings believed to be responsible for PMT-C area low magnesium and a low prostaglandin E1.  This condition of hypoglycemiais not unique to PMS but there are a number of different causes ofhypoglycemia, magnesium and PGE1 seem to be specific to PMS hypoglycemia\tA. Am. J. Psychiatry 147(4):477-80(1990)Unrefined complex carbohydrate should be substituted for sugar, magnesiumsupplementation and alpha linoleic acid supplementation(increased to 5-6% ofthe total calories) using safflower oil or evening primrose oil as sourcesof alpha linoleic acidPMT-D is characterized by elevated progesterone levels during the midlutealphase of a women's cycle.  Another cause of PMT-D has been found to be leadtoxicity(in women without elevated progesterone levels during the midlutealphase).

Salt restriction, B6, magnesium and vitamin Efor breast tenderness have all been effective in treating PMT-This general discussion of the PMS syndromes came form\tA. "Management of the premenstrual tension sundromes: Rational for\t    a nutritional approach". 1986, A Year in Nutritional Medicine.\t    J. Bland, Ed. Keats, Publishing, 1986\tB. "Nutritional factors in the etiology of premenstrual tension\t    syndromes", J. Reprod. Med.28(7):446-64(1983)\tC. "Premenstrual tension", Prob. Obstet. Gynecol. 3(12):1-39(1980Treatment has traditionally involved progesterone administration if you canfind a doctor who will treat you for PMS(just about as hard as finding onethat will treat you for candida blooms).  While progesterone will work,supplementation with vitamins and minerals works even better.  There reallyhas been an awful lot of research done on PMS(much more than candidablooms).  Many of these studies have been what are called experimentalcontrolled studies(the type of rigorous clinical studies that doctors like tosee done)Here are a few of these studies\tCARBOHYDRATE: Experimental Controlled Study, "Effect of a low-fat,\thigh-carbohydrate diet on symptoms of cyclical mastopathy" Lancet\t2:128-32(1988).  21 pts with severe persistent cyclical mastopathy\tof at least 5 years duration were randomly selected to receive\tspecific training to reduce dietary fat to 15% of total calories\tand increase complex carbohydrate ingestion or given general dietary\tadvise with no training.  After 6 months, there was a significant\treduction in the severity of the breast swelling and tenderness in\tthe trained group as reported by self-reported symptoms as well as\tphysical exams which quantitated the degree of breast swelling,\ttenderness and nodularity\tVITAMIN A: Experimental Controlled Study, "The use of Vitamin A in\tpremenstrual tension" Acta Obstet. Gynecol Scand. 39:586-92(1960). \t218 pts with severe recurring PMS received 200,000 to 300,000IU\tvitamin A daily or a placebo.  Serum retinol levels were monitored\tand high dose supplementation was discontinued when evidence of\ttoxicity occured(serum retinol above 450ug/ml).  The intent of the\tstudy was to load the liver up with vitamin A and get a normal pool\tsize(500,000IU to 1,000,000IU) and then see if this\tnormal vitamin A pool could prevent PMS.  48% getting the high dose\tvitamin A had complete remission of the symptoms of PMS.  Only 10%\tgetting the placebo reported getting complete relief of PMS sysmptoms  \t10% of the vitamin A treated group reported no improvement in PMS\tsymptoms\tExperimental Controlled Study, "Premenstrual tension treated with\tvitamin A" J. Clinical Endocrinology 10:1579-89(1950). 30 pts\treceived 200,000IU of vitamin A daily starting on day 15 of their\tcycle with supplementation continuing until the onset of PMS symptoms  \tAfter 2-6 months, all 30 pts reported a significant improvement in\tPMS symptoms.  Vitamin A supplementation was stopped once evidence of\ttoxicity was demonstrated and all 30 pts were followed for one year\tafter high dose vitamin A supplementation was stopped.  PMS symptoms\tdid not reoccur in any of these 30 pts for upto one year after the\tvitamin A supplementation was stoppedMost Americans do not have a normal store of vitamin A in their liver. These studies and several others were designed to see if getting a normalstore of vitamin A into the liver could eliminate PMS.  Of all the vitaminsgiven for PMS(vitamin A, B6, and vitamin E), vitamin A has shown the bestsingle effect.  This is probably because vitamin A is involved in steroid(estrogen/progesterone) metabolism in the liver.  Getting your liver fullof vitamin A seems to be one of the best things that you can do to preventthe symptoms of PMS.  But vitamin A is toxic and you don't want to be tryingto do this without being seen by a physician who can monitor you for vitaminA toxicity\tVITAMIN B6: Experimental Double-blind Crossoverr Study, "Pyridoxin\t(vitamin B6) and the premenstrual syndrome: A randomized crossover\ttrial"J.R. Coll. Gen. Pract. 39:364-68(1989).  32 women aged 18-49\twith moderate to severe PMS randomly received 50mg B6 daily or placebo  \tAfter 3 months the groups were switched and followed for another\t3 months.  B6 had a significant effect on the emotional aspects of\tPMS(depression, irritability and tiredness).  Other symptoms of PMS\twere not significanttly affected by B6 supplementation\tExperimental Double-blind Study, "The efects of vitamin B6\tsupplementation on premenstrual sysmptoms" Obstet. Gynecol\t70(2):145-49(1987).  55 pts with moderate to severe PMS received\t150mg B6 daily or placebo for 2 months.  Analysis of convergence\tshowed that B6 significantly improved premenstrual symptoms related\tto the autonomic nervous system(dizziness and vomiting) as well as\tbehavior changes(poor mental performance, decreased social interaction  \tAnxiety, depression and water retention were not improved by B6\tsupplementationVitamin B6 is below the RDA for both American men and women.  Birth controlpills and over 40 different drugs increase the B6 requirement in man. Women on birth control pills should be supplemented with 10-15 mg of B6 perday.  The dose should be increased if symptoms of PMS appear.  Dr. David R.Rubinow who heads the biological psychiatry branch of NIMH was quoted inClin. Psychiatry News, December, 1987 as stating that B6 should beconsidered the "first-line" drug for PMS(over progesterone) and if thepatient does not respond, then other treatments should be tried.  VitaminB6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if consumed in doses of 500mg or more eachday.\tVITAMIN E: Experimental Double-blind Study, "Efficacy of alpha\ttocopherol in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome" J. Reprod.\tMed. 32(6):400-04(1987). 35 pts received 400IU vitamin E daily for 3\tcycles or a placebo.  Vitamin E treated pts had 33% who reported a\tsignificant reduction in physical symptoms(weight gain and breast\ttenderness) while the placebo group had 14% who reported a significan \treduction in physical symptoms. The vitamin E group reported that 38%\thad a significant reduction in anxiety versus 12% for the placebo\tgroup.  For depression, the vitamin E group had 27% with a significan\tdecrease in depression compared with 8% for the placebo group\tExperimental Double-blind Study, "The effect of alpha-tocopherol on\tpremenstrual symptomalogy: A double blind study" J. Am. Coll. Nutr.\t2(2):115-122(1983). 75pts with benign breast disease and PMT randomly\treceived vitamin E at 75IU, 150IU, or 300IU daily or placebo.  After\t2 months of supplementation, 150IU of vitamin E or higher significantly\timproved PMT-A and PMT-C.  The 300IU dose was needed to significantly\timprove PMT-D.  No dose of vitamin E significantly improved PMT-\t(other studies have shown that a higher vitamin E doses will relieve\tPMT-H symptoms)\\tMAGNESIUM: Experimental Double-blind Study, "Magnesium prophylaxis\tof menstrual migraine: effects on itracellular magnesium" Headache\t31:298-304(1991). 20 pts with perimenstrual headache received 360 mg\tdaily of magnesium as magnesium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid or a\tplacebo.  Treatment was started on the 15th day of the cycle and\tcontinued until menstruation. After 2 months, the Pain Total Index\twas significantly lower in the magnesium group.  Magnesium treatment\twas also assocoiated with a significant reduction in the Menstrual\tDistress Questionnaire scores.  Pretreatment magnesium levels in \tlymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes were significantly lower\tin this group of 20 pts compared to control women who did not suffer\tfrom PMS.  After treatment, magnesium levels in these cells was raised\tinto the normal range\tExperimental Double-blind Study, "Oral Magnesium successfully\trelieves premenstrual mood changes" Obstet. Gynecol 78(2):177-81(1991).\t32pts aged 24-39 randomly received either magnesium carboxylic acid\t360mg of Mg per day or a placebo from the 15th day of the cycle to the\tonset of the menstrual flow.  After 2 cycles, both groups received\tmagnesium.  The Menstrual Distress Questionnaire score of the cluster\tpain was significantly reduced during the second cycle(month) for the\tmagnesium treatment group as well as the placebo group once they were\tswitched to magnesium supplementation.  In addition, the total score on\tthe Menstrual Distress Questionnaire was significantly decreased by\tmagnesium supplementation.  The authors suggest that magnesium\tsupplemenation should become a routine treatment for the mood changes\tthat occur during PMSThere are numerous observational studies that have been published in themedical literature which also suggest that PMS is primarily a disorderthat arises out of a hormone imbalance that is dietary in nature.  Butsince observational studies are considered by most physicians in Sci. Med.to be anecdotal in nature, I have not bothered to cite them.  There arealso over a half dozen good experimental studies that have been done onmultivitamin and mineral supplementation to prevent PMS.  I've chosen thebest specific studies on individual vitamins and minerals to try to point outthat PMS is primarily a nutritional disorder.  But doctors don't recognizenutritional disorders unless they can see clinical pathology(beri-beri,pellagra, scruvy, etc.).  PMS is probably the best reason why every doctorbeing trained in the U.S. should get a good course on human nutrition.  PMSis really only the tip if the iceberg when it comes to nutritionaldisorders.  It's time that medicine woke up and smelled the rosesHere's some studies which show the importance in multivitamin/mineralsupplementation and/or diet change in preventing PMS\tExperimental Study, "Effect of a nutritional programme on\tpremenstrual syndrome: a retrospective analysis", Complement. Med.\tRes.5(1):8-11(1991).  200pts were given dietary instructions and\tsupplemented with Optivite(R) plus additional vitamin C, vitamin E,\tmagnesium, zinc and primrose oil.  The dietary instructions were to\ttake the supplements and switch to a low fat, complex carbohydrate\tdiet.  On a retrospective analysis, 96.5% of the 200pts reported an\timprovement in their PMS symptoms with 30% of the sample stating that\tthey no longer suffered from PMS.\tExperimental Double-blind Study, "Role of Nutrition in managing\tpremenstrual tension syndromes", J Reprod. Med. 32(6):405-22(1987). \tA low fat, high complex carbohydrate diet along with Optivite\tsupplementation significantly decreased PMS scores compared with diet\tchange and placebo.  After 6 months on the experimental program, the\tvitamin/mineral supplementated group had significantly decreased\testradiol and increased progesterone in serum during the midlutel\tphase of their cycle\tExperimental Double-blind Study, "Clinical and biochemical effects\tof nutritional supplementation on the premenstrual syndrome", J.\tReprod. Med. 32(6):435-41(1987). 119pts randomly given Optivite(12\ttablets per day) or a placebo.  The treated groups showed a\tsignificant decrease in PMS symptoms compared to the placebo.  Anothe \tgroup of 104pts got Optivite(4 tablets per day) or placebo.  For this\tsecond group of patients, no significant effect of supplementation on\tPMS symptoms was observedMartin Banschbach, Ph.DProfessor of Biochemistry and ChairmaDepartment of Biochemistry and MicrobiologOSU College of Osteopathic Medicin1111 W. 17th StTulsa, Ok 7410"Without discourse, there is no remembering, without remembering, there isno learning, without learning, there is only ignorance"

Does anyone know if either theophylline or ephedrine, or the two icombination, can reduce the body's ability to make use ofavailable water?  I had kind of an odd experience on a group hikrecently, becoming dehyrated after about 9 hours of rigorouhiking despite having brought 1 1/2 gallons of water (c. 6 liters)I drank close to twice as much as anyone else, and no one else wadehydrated.  I don't think general physical condition was an issuesince I was in at least the middle of the pack in terms of generastamina, so far as I could tellIt may be that I just plain need more water than most people.  But I awondering if theophylline and/or ephedrine might be aggravating thingsI took a couple of Primatene tablets during the hike to control asthm(24 mg. ephedrine, 100 mg. theophylline).  I gather that both thosdrugs are diuretics.  So now I'm wondering: does that mean they careduce the body's ability to utilize available water?  Would it be particularly  stupid thing to take that medication during hot-weatheexercise?  (I always assumed diuresis just meant you urinated a lot, buthat wasn't the case yesterday.

There is also the possibility that lung tissue in patients with lungdisease has become calcified(chest x-rays would show this).  There are sid-effects to the use of EDTA because it is not specific for calcium(it alsobinds other minerals).  I think that there have been some deaths whenEDTA chelation therapy has been used because of mineral imbalances thatwere not detected and corrected.  In animal studies, the best way to removecalcium from plaques in rabbits was to supplement the rabbits with vitamin Cand magnesium(rabbits already synthesize their own vitamin C, the extravitamin C was given in their diets to help the magnesium displace the calciumfrom the plaques)The calcification process that occurs in both plaques and the lung probablycan be prevented if magnesium is used in supplemental form.

L.acidophilus is the major bacteria in the vaginal tract and is primarilyresponsible for keeping the vaginal tract acidic and yeast free.  Most ofthe commercial yogurt sold in the U.S. has a very low L. acidophilus and L.bulgaricus count.  Neither of these bacteria are obligate anaerobes with aremuch more important in dealing with the diarrhea problem.  Gordon R. has toldme through e-mail that he gives his patients L. acidophilus and severaldifferent obligate anaerobes(which set-up shop in the colon) but he hasn'ttold me which ones yet.  The Lactobacillus genera are mostly facultativeanaerobes and will set-up shop where they have access to oxygen if given achance(mouth, anus, sinus cavity and vagina).  Having these good bacteriaaround will greatly decrease the chance of candida blooms in the analregion or the vagina.  I have not proposed a systemic action for candidablooms.  I know that others swear that all kinds of symptoms arise fromthe evil yeast blooms in the body.  I'm not ready to buy that yet.  I dobelieve that complications at specific sites(vagina, anal and maybe lowercolon, sinus and mouth) can result from antibiotic use which removes thecompeting bacteria from these sites and thus lets candida grow uncheckedRestoring the right bacterial balance is the best way(in my opinion) to getrid of the problem.  Anti-fungals, a low carbohydrate diet and vitamin Asupplementation may all help to minimize the local irritation until thegood bacteria can take over control of the food supply again and lower thepH to basically starve the candida outMarty B

Acidophilus orally and see it it can decrease thefrequency and extent of candida blooms in the vagina since most of thecandida seems to be migrating in from the anal region and L. acidophilusshould be able keep the candida in check if it can make it through theintestinal tract and colonize in the anus where it will have access tooxygen(just like it does in the vagina).  As much stuff as there is in thelay press about L. acidophilus and vaginal yeast infections, I'm reallyamazed that someone has not done a clinical trial yet to check it outThe calcium and kidney stone story is not a good reason to throw allconventional wisdom out the window.  Where would medicine be ifconventional wisdom had not been used to develop many of the standardmedical practices that could not be confirmed through clinical trialsThe clinical trial is a very new arrival on the medical scene(and a veryimportant one).  The lack of proof that reinnoculation with good bacteriaafter antibiotic use is important to the health of a patient is no reasonto dismiss it out-of-hand, especially if reinnoculation can be done cleaplyand safely(like it is in animal husbandry)Marty B

Here is a press release from the American Federation of State,County and Municipal Employees Unions Point To Deadly Workplaces; AFSCME, Other UnionCommemorate Workers Memorial Da To: National Desk, Labor Write Contact: Janet Rivera of the American Federation of State, Countand Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO, 202-429-113   WASHINGTON, April 23 -- The American Federation of State,County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and other unionof the AFL-CIO on Wednesday, April 28, will commemorate the fiftannual Workers Memorial Day -- a day to pay homage to the million workers who are killed, injured, or diseased on the job   This year, AFSCME will focus its Workers Memorial Day efforts athe dangerous environment in which corrections officers must workEarlier this month, an AFSCME corrections officer, RoberVallandingham, was killed by inmates who overtook the correctionfacility in Lucasville, Ohio   The law and order agenda of the 1980s has resulted in a steadincrease in the prison population for the past five years.  OJn. 1, 1992, the prison population was 709,587. Projectionshow a continued increase in the number of inmates, with aexpected prison population of 811,253 in 1994   The conditions which this burgeoning prison population hacreated for corrections officers is partially reflected in thnumber of assaults by inmates against staff.  Assaults againsstaff increased dramatically between 1987 and 1989, and remaihigh.  In 1987, there were 808 assaults by inmates against staffcompared to 9,961 such assaults in 1991   The increased number of inmates has brought on the dangeroucombination of overcrowding and understaffing.  For example in Ohiofficer-to-inmate ratio is 1 to 8.4 -- the second worst ratio ithe nation. The national average is 1 to 5.3.  Other health ansafety issues facing corrections officers include AIDS, HepatitiB, tuberculosis, stress, and chemical hazards   AFSCME has more than 50,000 members who work in the nation'federal, state and local correctional facilities   Correction officers are not alone in performing their jobs undelife-threatening conditions.  Every year, 10,000 American workerdie from job-related injuries, and tens of thousands more die frooccupational disease.  Public employees do some of the nation'most dangerous jobs. Perilous occupations include   -- Highway Workers - Highway workers are often injured an      frequently killed by moving traffic because work zones ar      not barricaded or don't have proper lighting   -- Health Care Workers - Hospitals have the highest number o      job-related injuries and illnesses of any private secto      employer and nursing homes ranked fifth.  There were mor      than 325,000 job-related illnesses and injuries in privat      sector hospitals in 1991, up almost 10 percent over th      previous year.  It is generally believed that health car      workers employed at public sector hospitals and nursing home      have a significantly higher rate of injuries and illnesse      than do their private sector counterparts.  Health and safet      issues facing health care workers include exposure t      tuberculosis and the HIV virus, back injuries, and hig      levels of stress   -- Social Workers - Social workers who work in mental healt      institutions are often the victims of assaults and      sometimes, fatal attacks.  For instance, last October, a ma      carrying a semiautomatic handgun walked into the Schuyle      County Social Services Building in Watkins Glenn, N.Y      and fatally shot social services workers, before turning th      gun on himself.  There are two basic problems.  First is       growing lack of support services for people who don't hav      the help they need.  Because workers are overworked, som      clients are not given the adequate amount of counselling      Such conditions may cause clients to become more frustrated      The "quality" of the clients is also becoming more violent      as more are moved out of the institutions   Nearly 2 million workers have been killed by workplace hazardsince OSHA was passed.  Moreover, as AFSCME President Gerald WMcEntee explains, OSHA does not provide workplace safetprotections for public employees   "More than 1,600 public employees are killed each year on thjob, yet 27 states still provide no federally-approved OSHcoverage for public employees," said McEntee.  "This, despite thfact that public employees -- highway workers, health care workerscorrections officers, to name but a few -- do some of the mosdangerous work in our society.  This year we are fighting fopassage of OSHA reform legislation to give all workers greaterights and protections, and finally guarantee all public employeesafe workplaces.  We need the public support to be successful.   Government workers suffer 25 percent more injuries than privatsector workers, and these injuries are almost 75 percent morsevere   Public employees were exempted from OSHA when the law was passein 1970 and today, public employees in more than half the statehave no OSHA coverage -30-Canada Remote Systems - Toronto, Ontari416-629-7000/629-704

We can't seem t>focus in on a disease, a therapy, or a hypothesis under discussion.>         >                           I'm lostPoint 1I'm beginning to see that *part* of the disagreements about the whol"yeast issue" is on differing perceptions and on differing meaningof words.  Medical doctors have a very specific and specialized "jargon"necessary for precise communication within their field (which I'm fullcognizant of since I, too, speak "jargonese" when with my peers).  For thsituation in sci.med, many times the words or phrases used by doctors cahave a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in thworld at large, causing significant miscommunication.  One example wordand very relevant to the yeast discussion, is the exact meaning of "systemic"It is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific, mucmore so than its meaning to a non-doctor.  There is also the observation othis newsgroup that both doctors and non-doctors come together on essentiallequal terms, which, when combined with the jargon issue, can further fathe flames.  This is probably the first time that practicing doctors gereally "beat up" by non-doctors for their views on medicine, which theotherwise don't see much of in their practice except for the occasiona"difficult" patientPoint 2I understand the viewpoint among many practicing doctors that they will noprescribe any treatments/therapies for their patients unless such treatmenthave been shown to be effective and the risks understood from well-constructeclinical trials (usually double-blind), or that such treatments/therapies arpart of an approved and funded clinical trial.  To these doctors, to do andifferently would, in this belief system, be unethical practice.  And ifollows that any therapy not on the "accepted" list is therefore a nontherapy - it does not even exist, nor does the underlying hypothesis otheory have any validity, even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolatioof what is currently known.  Anecdotal evidence has no value, either, froa treatment point-of-viewAnd by and large, as a scientist myself, I am glad that medical practicescience takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment.  However, aalso being a human being (last I checked), and having been one of those peoplthat has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment, wher"standard" medicine was not able to help me, has caused me to sit back anwonder if holding such an extreme and rigid "scientific" viewpoint is iitself unethical from humanitarian considerations.  After all, the underlyinintent of the "scientific" approach to medicine is to protect the health othe patient by providing the best possible care for the patient, so thpatient should come first when considering treatmentWhat we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies botthe "scientific" and the "humanitarian" viewpoints.  In an earlier post outlined a crazy idea for doing just that.  The gist of it was to give anphysician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribalternate, not yet proven therapies (maybe supported by anecdotal evidencefor patients who *all* avenues of accepted therapies have been exhauste(and not until then).  The patient would be fully informed that suctherapies/treatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and thathere are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derivefrom themThis approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor.  It also satisfiethe humanitarian needs of the patient.  And the reality is that many patientwho have reached a dead-end in the treatment of their symptoms using acceptemedicine *will* go outside the orthodox medical community:  either to thdoctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losintheir license, or worse, to non-doctors who have not had the proper medicatraining.  This approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the contromore within orthodox medicine, with the benefits that the information gleanecould help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the mosproductive way.  Everybody wins in this admittedly rose-colored approach - I'sure there are real problems with this approach as well - it is presentemore as a strawman to stimulate discussionHopefully what I write here may give the sci.med doctors a better idea as twhy I am "open" to alternative therapies, as well as why I have readifficulty (read "apparent hostility") with the "coldness" of the 99.9% pur"scientific" approach to medicine.  I believe the best approach to medicatreatment is one where both the "humanitarian" aspects are balanced with anby the "scientific" aspects.  Anything else is just not good medicine, imhoJust my 'NF' leanings, I guess.  :^CommentsJon Norin--Charter Member --->>>  INFJ ClubIf you're dying to know what INFJ means, be brave, e-mail me, I'll send info============================================================================| Jon Noring          | noring@netcom.com        |                          | JKN International   | IP    : 192.100.81.100   | FRED'S GOURMET CHOCOLATE | 1312 Carlton Place  | Phone : (510) 294-8153   | CHIPS - World's Best!    | Livermore, CA 94550 | V-Mail: (510) 417-4101   |                          ============================================================================Who are you?

She said even common ear infections frequently seen ichildren are becoming resistant to antibiotic treatment"Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious  diseasewould soon be eliminated as a public health problem, infectious diseaseremain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illnesand death in the United States," the CDC saidIt  cited  the  emergence since the 1970s of a "myriad" of newlidentified pathogens and syndromes, such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, deadly bacterial infection; the hepatitis C virus; HIV, the virus thacauses AIDS; Legionnaires disease; Lyme disease; and toxic shock syndrome"The incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under controlsuch as cholera, malaria and tuberculosis, have increased in many areas,the CDC said.  It said efforts at control and prevention have beeundermined by drug resistance=====*====SOURCE:  WALL STREET JOURNAREFERENCE: 04/15/93, pBHEADLINE: Lyme-Disease Ruling Raises Liability IssueThe tick that causes Lyme disease may have found a new way to causdamage: legal liabilityA federal judge's decision holding a property owner liable for nodoing enough to protect workers from Lyme disease is getting as mucattention as the latest medical study on the disease, a flu-likillness that can cause severe physical and mental disabilities and irare instances death. The decision last week has put property owneron notice that they may have to do more than protect themselves frothe ticks-they also may have to protect themselves from litigation isomeone becomes infected while on the propertyThe decision by U.S. District Judge Robert J. Ward in New York camafter a week-long trial in a case involving four track workers for thLong Island Railroad. Judge Ward found that the workers contracted thdisease after they were bitten by ticks while on the job. He orderethe New York state-owned commuter line to pay the workers more tha$560,000 to compensate for pain and suffering, in addition to medicaexpenses and lost wagesSummer camps, schools, companies with facilities in rural osemirural areas, and homeowners who rent to vacationers are among thgroups that need to be worried about this ruling, says Stephen LKass, an attorney at New York law firm Berle, Kass & Case, who wrote legal article three years ago warning property owners of the potentialiability. Even a family that invites friends over for a backyarbarbecue might be potentially liableLawsuits for insect bites, while rare, aren't unheard-of. A summevacationer in Southampton, N.Y., last year sued the owner of the homshe rented, claiming that a tick on the property gave her RockMountain spotted fever. In 1988, also on Long Island, a jury orderean outdoor restaurant to pay more than $3 million to a patron who wastung by a bee, causing an allergic reaction and permanenquadriplegia. The judge later threw out the award, citing no evidencthat a beehive was near the restaurantBut lawyers say that the attention to Lyme disease throughout thcountry -- it's most prevalent in New England, the Middle Atlantistates, Wisconsin, Minnesota and the Northwest -- may make thiparticular insect bite a particularly litigious oneThe illness already has proved to be a source of controversy in thcourtroom over such issues as the type of medical care insurers wilcover and medical malpractice claims against doctors for nodiagnosing the diseaseLawyers say worker's-compensation claims related to Lyme diseashave become common in some states in recent years. Payments iworker's-compensation cases, however, are limited to medical costs anlost earningsThe case before Judge Ward dealt with a potentially much morlucrative avenue for damages, because it involved the question onegligence. Unlike the worker's compensation process, the law governininjuries to rail workers allows for a finding of negligence and, as result, for additional payments for pain and suffering. Propertowners and lawyers say that negligence claims can be made in manother situations where people are exposed to the ticks that carry thdiseaseIra M. Maurer, a partner at New York law firm Elkind, Flynn Maurer, who represented the rail workers, says the decision will helto establish "the duty of all sorts of property owners to protecagainst Lyme disease.Lawyers caution that despite Judge Ward's decision, winning lawsuit for damages caused by Lyme disease may prove difficult. Foone thing, victims have to demonstrate that they have pinned down wheand where they got the tick bite. Judge Ward found that the plaintiffin the railroad case got Lyme disease while working on property owneby the railroad, even though none of the men remembered being bittenThe workers, who weren't outdoorsmen likely to be exposed elsewhere tthe insects, said they saw ticks in the high grass that surroundesome work sitesA spokeswoman for the railroad says that there was no proof thathe four men were bitten while on the job and that the railroad iconsidering an appeal. The railroad also disputes Judge Ward's findinthat it didn't do enough to protect employees. The spokeswoman saythe railroad provides track workers with insect repellent and speciapants to protect against bug bitesDebate in the scientific community over Lyme disease could open usome legal defenses for property owners, such as questioning whether victim actually has the disease rather than some other illnessEarlier this week, the Journal of the American Medical Associatioreported that doctors overly diagnose patients as having Lyme diseaseAnd damages awarded to a victim also might be influenced by medicadisputes over the degree of harm that Lyme disease causesBecause of health and safety concerns, some groups and companiealready take special measures to protect against Lyme disease. Lasyear, at its headquarters in Franklin Lakes, N.J., Becton, Dickinson Co. began using Damminix, a pesticide made by EcoHealth Inc. of Bostothat is designed to kill ticks carrying the disease. The medicalsupply company's headquarters include a 120-acre park, and the companwas worried that employees who walk on its trails for recreation mighget infectedRuth Lister, a spokeswoman for the American Camping Association iIndianapolis, says that many youth camps accredited by heorganization also have begun to check children for ticks. And CarolKatz, a member of the board of the Fire Island Pines Property OwnerAssociation, says her group spends $30,000 each year to treat thei100-acre site off the coast of New York with the tick-killinpesticide=====*====TITLE: Urinary dysfunction in Lyme diseaseAUTHORS: Chancellor MB; McGinnis DE; Shenot PJ; Kiilholma P; Hirsch IHDepartment of Urology, Jefferson Medical College, Thomas JeffersoUniversity, Philadelphia, PennsylvaniaREFERENCE: J Urol 1993 Jan; 149 (1): 26-3Lyme disease, which is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, iassociated with a variety of neurological sequelae.

I think you must have the same hygiene teacher I had in 1955.  Thereis a story about the Civil War about a soldier who was shot in thgroin.  The bullet, after passing through one of his testes, then enterethe abdomen of a young woman standing nearby.  Later,  when she (a younwoman of unimpeachible virtue) was shown to be pregnant; the soldier dithe honorable thing of marrying her.  According to this story, they livehappily ever after. Perhaps the most famous of Mr. Rau's classes was the time he would cominto class brandishing an aluminum turning mandrel  (tapering from abou3/8" to 1/2" over a 10 inch length).  He would say, "Boys, do you knowhat this is?  It's a medical instrument called a 'cock reamer' and it'used to unclog your penis when you have VD.  They just ram it up therwithout an anesthetic!"  Needless to say this had a chilling effectI didn't have lascivious thoughts for at least an hour.

Recently I've come upon a body of literature which promotes colocleansing as a vital aid to preventive medicine through nutrition.

In cats, the protozoan multiplies in thintestinal cells and eggs are shed in the cat's feces.  The protozoa cacross the placenta to infect the fetus.  The disease may be asymptomatiafter the baby is born, or it may be very severe.  Toxo may cause blindnesand mental retardationHaving a cat in the same apartment should not be a problem; however, pregnanwomen should not scoop or change the cat's litterbox.

Dear NettersMaybe one of you can explain this.  From time to time I experiencea strange kind of feeling (I have all kinds of weird feelings) whichcan be best described as the feeling of "losing gravity", like that oneexperiences in a descending elevator.  Needless to say, it is notenjoyable.  It sometimes comes with shortness of breath and extremefatigue.  It lasts from a few minutes to an hour and when it laststhat long, it makes me sweateningInitially I called it "palpitation (spelling?)" until I later learnt thatthe terminology has been reserved for the self-awareness of heart beatsSo, is there a specific term for this feeling, or am I a stragne personI always believe I am unique.ThanksPin

I'm a fellow applicant and my situation is not too much better.  I applieto about 20 schools, got two interviews, got one offer, and am waiting thear from the other schoolLet me be honest about my experiences and impressions about the medicaschool admissions process.  Numbers (GPA, MCATs) are not everything,but they are probably more important than anything else.  In fact, somschools screen out applicants based on these numbers and never even looat your other qualities.  Of course, when this happens, don't expect a refunon your $50 application feeBut, the fact that you got four interviews tells me that you have the numberand are very well qualified academically.  You mentioned one response, was ian acceptance, denial, or wait-list?  If I assume the worst, that it was denial, then you still have a great probability of acceptance somewhere.  Hodid your interviews goAs for how long you have to wait, I've called a few schools who never contacteme for anything.  Many of them told me that the interview season for them waover and that if I haven't heard by now, I can assume a denial.  Many rejectioletters are not sent out until May or as late as June.  But some schools arstill interviewing. I really don't think you should worry.  Don't becomfixated on the mailbox, go out, have fun, be very proud of yourselfWhat do people think of the medical school admissions process?  I had a vermediocre GPA, but high MCAT scores, and I have been working as a softwarengineer for two years.  I majored in Computer Science at Stanford.  StillI think the profile of the person who has the best chance of getting admitteis something like thisVERY IMPORTAN-------------GPA:\t3.5 or betteMCAT:   top 15% in all subjecMEDIUM IMPORTANC----------------Writing/Speaking abilitMaturitMotivation for going into medicinActivitieLESS IMPORTAN-------------College or UniversitMajoWork experiencAnything else you want them to knoAnyway, you are in good shape.  I think admissions committees are bound imany ways by the numbers, but would like very much to understand eacperson as an individual.  Sometimes thats just not practical.  But gettingfour interviews is an indicator that you have the numbers.  Hopefully, yowere able to impress them with your characterGood luckJef

Gordon Rubenfeld did a Medlinesearch and also sent me the same reference through e-mail.  Sincecommercial yogurt does not always have a good Lactobacillus a. orbulgaricus culture, a negative finding would not have been too informativeThis is often the reason why Lactobacillus acidophilus tablets arerecommended rather than yogurtI guess the next question is why would this introduction of "good" bacteriaback into the gut decrease the incidence of vaginal candida blooms if theanus was not serving as a candida reservoir(a fact that Gordon R. vehementdenys)?  I see two possible theories.  One, the L. acidophilus, which is afacultatively anaerobic bacterium, could make it through the gut andcolonize the rectal area to overgrow the candida.  This would not explainthe reoccurance of candida blooms in the vagina after the yogurt ingestionwas stopped though.  The other is that the additional bacteria in theintestinal tract remove most of the glucose from the feces and candidalooses it's major food sourceGetting Lactobacillus acidophilus to colonize the vaginal tract(where it isnormally found) would have a much better effect on the recurrance of vaginalyeast blooms though.  An acetic acid, Lactobacillus acidophilus douche hasbeen used to get this effect but I've not seen any such treatment reported inthe medical literature.  This would be an example of physicians conductingtheir own clinical trials to try to come up with treatments that help theirpatients.  When this is done in private practice, the results are rarely, ifever published.  It was the hallmark of medicine until the modern ageemerged with clinical trials.  It really raises a big question.  Does themedical profession cast out the adventerous few who try new treatments tohelp patients or does it look the other wayThis particular issue is really a very simple one since no real dangeroustherapy is involved(even the anti-fungals are not all that dangerous).  Butthere are some areas(like EDTA chelation therapy), where the fire is prettyhot and somebody could get burned.  It's really tough.  Do I follow onlywell established protocols and then give up if they don't work that well ordo it try something that looks like it will work but hasn't been proven towork yetMy stand is to consider other treatment possibilities, especially if theyinvolve little or no risk to the patient.  Getting good bacteria back intothe gut after antibiotic treatment is one treatment possibility.  The otheris getting L. acidophilus into the vaginal tract of a woman who is having aproblem with recurring yeast infectionsMarty B

I used to be on lopid.  It did a good job of reducing cholesterol (29down to around 214), as well as LDL and triglycerides.  Then, I gopneumonia, and for some reason, the Lopid stopped working very wellcholesterol and triglycerides soared.  The levels might have stabilizeover time, but a new doctor had me quit, wait a month, then switcto Mevicore. On Mevicore, my total cholesterol was down to 207,  LDL was 108,and HDL was 35; but the trig's were stilvery high, around 318, and my liver tests came back slightly abnormal,SGOT = 83 (N = 1-35),  GGTP(?hard to read copy) = 42 (N = 0 - 35)He said the liver numbers were not offbase enough to cause hiconcern, and the triglycerides are not as important as the cholesterofigures.  He had me stop the Mevicore to allow the liver to heal ("Justo be extra cautious, though I\'m sure it\'s not a problem.")and wants me to go back on it after that.  I suggested maybe Lopid mighbe the better choice, and he said that he wouldn't object if that's whaI want to do.  But Lopid has one particular side effect I'm not fond ofShould the above liver and trig figures be feared?  What happens tfolks with high trig levels?  Is my liver in danger with the abovresults?  Would I be better off on Lopid, despite its inconvenientside effect, or, perhaps, some other drug?  (Niacin affected myliver, too)

Can anybody out there provide me with any advice concerning thfollowing two health problemsFirst, I was recently diagnosed (using a UGI series) as having Schatzki ring and small sliding hiatal hernia. As I understand itthe hernia is a relatively minor problem, though I do occasionallhave some nasty heartburn that is probably related to it. The Schatzkring, on the other hand, is causing swallowing difficulty. In particularif I'm not careful about eating slowly, and thoroughly chewing foodfood occasionally gets "stuck" before reaching my stomach. This resultin a period of painful spasms as the food attempts to pass the obstructionFortunately, the food has always managed to pass, but this is annoyingand causes frequent discomfortMy doctor wants to "dilate" the ring using thfollowing procedure: use an endoscope to examine the esophagus and stomacfor any inflammation, then cut through the ring and dilate it by passinsome kind of balloon or something thru the esophagous. I would like to knoif anyone out there has had this (or a similar) procedure done-if sowas it painful, successful, etc. Also, can anyone  comment osafety, advisability, and success rate of this procedure? Has it becoma common procedure? I am kind of leery of having such an invasive-soundinprocedure performed for a (currently) non-threatening condition such as thisespecially considering the possible side effects (bleeding, perforationreaction to anesthesia)The second issue: for the past 3-4 years I have had a large numbeof "extra" heartbeats. In particular, during the past month or so therhas been a dramatic increase-a Holter monitor recently showed 50 PVC's in 2hrs, along with a few PAC's. (Many days, there are far more than thishowever-five to ten per hour). All of them were isolated, and the cardiologisindicated that such a number was "normal". It certainly doesn\'feel normal. In the past there have also been a couple of episodes oextended "runs" of these beats, one of which lasted long enough to caussevere light-headedness. I am relatively young (30-ish), thin and in goohealth (recent bloodtests were all normal), and do not smoke, use drugs ocaffeine, etc. I\'m willing to accept the extra beats as "normal", but don\'want to ignore them if they might be some kind of warning symptom. The numbeof PVC's seems to increase throughout the day, and with exercise (or somethinas simple as climbing some stairs). Also, if I get up after sitting or lyindown for a while, I tend to get a couple of extra beats. Could they possiblbe related to the esophagous problems? Both seemed to develop at about thsame timeThanks for any help/advice============================================================================================================================================================

ANNOUNCEMENT:\tThe "HyperKnowledge" PROJECT for NeXTSTEMotivatioWe are a heterogeneous group of scientists and students who feel that our work is continuously hindered by computer environments dominated by incompatible scientific tools and monstrous software packages (too often claiming to do everything).  Rather than being able to use different tools together in a flexible, interactive system, we find ourselves spending too much time converting between different data formats, writing throw-away tools and I/O parsers, and worrying about how to get to a particular goal rather than what it means to have attained itWhat we need is an object-oriented scientific environment where the tools we choose to use are integrated without being parts of a closed system, highly interactive, and extendable (both by the addition of our own specialized objects and by combining the available tools - graphically).  The use of such an environment should be a natural extension of our work, requiring a very short learning phase and practically no user-documentation.  The user should feel encouraged to explore different possibilities, testing his/her own scientific ideas without worrying too much about whether the system is able to cope (within reason, of course).  By building an open and object-oriented system, each user should be able to draw upon and combine those tools necessary or conducive to a particular task: we all need to organize and archive our data, display results, and combine information from many different sourcesCurrently, the group consists of people from very different fields: Molecular Biology, Computer Science, Physics and Astronomy, and Geography.  While many of our needs for such an environment diverge, the underlying motivation is the same: no matter what you want to call it, we need a system which helps rather than hinders the organization of our scientific data and daily workWhy NeXTSTEPWhat else is there?  No other system offers the same power, a totally object-oriented developers environment, UNIX-compatibility, highly-interactive and standardized user-interface.  With the advent of NS486 and the expectation that NeXTSTEP will soon appear on a broad range of hardware platforms, such a system will soon be nearly universally available.  Classical workstation vendors (SUN, IBM, HP, and the rest) now have little to offer, no similar tools exist for the standard X-Windows GUI, if Apple had a system it would only run on their hardware, and the mass-market Windows/DOS world is a developer's nightmare (either despite, or more probably because of, OLE)In order to progress, we need an open discussion of how best to develop such an environment.  In NeXTSTEP parlance, do we simply have to put together a set of scientific protocols and a common API for our "Hyper-knowledge" servers? Should be use distributed objects?  What minimum set of tools do we need in order to start working with the environment?  What tool-needs do we all have in common and which ones are best developed by specialized sub-groups?  How many already existing tools can/should be integrated into the system (e.g. Mathematica)?  Do we need an "AVS"-like tool for data-flow manipulationMailing list and Anonymous ftIn order to take part to the project or to push the discussion forewords, you are invited to subscribe to: sci-tools@embl-heidelberg.dAll (interesting) suggestions, projects and sources will be archive and soon available (anonymous ftp)For questions send mail to sci-tools-help@embl-heidelberg.dAcknowledgmentThe European Molecular Biology Laboratory (Heidelberg, Germany) has consented to provide the computer resources for a mailing list and anonymous ftp servicesRick Hessman    <hessman@eden.uni-sw.gwdg.deGeorg Tuparev   <tuparev@embl-heidelberg.de

Here is a press release from Huntington Medical Research Institutes New Method For Diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease Discovered aHuntington Medical Research Institutes: Results to Be Reporte To: National Desk, Health Write Contact: John Lockhart or Belinda Gerber, 310-444-7000, o          800-522-8877, for the Huntington Medical Researc          Institutes   LOS ANGELES, April 28  -- A new method for diagnosingand measuring chemical imbalances in the braiwhich lead to Alzheimer's disease and other dementias has beediscovered by researchers at the Huntington Medical ResearcInstitutes (HMRI) in Pasadena, Calif.  Results of their researcwill be reported in the May issue of the scientific journalRadiology   Using an advanced form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRIcalled magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), a research team leby Brian D. Ross, M.D., D. Phil., conducted a study on 21 elderlpatients who were believed to be suffering from some form odementia. The exams used standard MRI equipment fitted with speciasoftware developed at HMRI called Clinical Proton MRS.  ClinicaProton MRS is easily applied, giving doctors confirmatory diagnosein less than 30 minutes.  An automated version of Clinical ProtoMRS called Proton Brain Examination (PROBE) reduces the examinatiotime yet further, providing confirmatory diagnoses in less than 1minutes.  By comparison, the current "standard of care" in testinfor Alzheimer's disease calls for lengthy memory function anneuropsychological tests, which can be very upsetting to thpatient, are not definitive and can only be confirmed by autopsy   In addition to Alzheimer's disease, the new Clinical Proton MRexam may have applications in diagnosing other dementias, includinAIDS-related dementia, Parkinson's disease and Huntington'disease   "We\'ve developed a simple test which can be administered quickland relatively inexpensively using existing MRI equipment fittewith either the MRS or PROBE software," said Dr. Ross, adding"this will help physicians to diagnose Alzheimer\'s earlier anintervene with therapeutics before the progression of the diseascauses further damage to the delicate inner workings of the brain.   Dr. Ross and his HMRI team measured a family of chemicals in thbrain known as inositols, and myo-inositol (MI) acted as a markein the study.  In comparison to healthy patients, those diagnosewith Alzheimer's showed a 22 percent increase in MI, while theilevel of another chemical called N-acetylaspartate (NAA) wasignificantly lower, indicating a loss of brain-stimulating neuronbelieved to be associated with the progression of the disease   Current drug therapy for Alzheimer's disease is widelconsidered to be inadequate.  This is attributable, Dr. Rosbelieves, to the theory that Alzheimer's is caused by ainterruption in the transmission of the chemical acetylcholine tthe nerve cells. This belief has been adhered to over the last 1years, and consequently, most drugs to treat Alzheimer's were baseon the changing receptors for acetylcholine   "Physicians have a real need for a test to differentiatAlzheimer's from other dementias, to provide the patient and his oher family with a firm diagnosis and to monitor future treatmenprotocols for the treatment of this disease.  For this reason, wconsider this test a major advancement in medicine," said BrucMiller, M.D., a noted neurologist at Harbor-UCLA, MRS researcheand a co-author of the study   Other members of the HMRI research team included Rex A. MoatsPh.D., Truda Shonk, B.S., Thomas Ernst, Ph.D., and Suzanne WoolleyR.N.  The PROBE software can be fitted on the approximately 1,20General Electric MRI units currently in use in the United Statesand will be configured for other manufacturers' MRI units soon   For interviews with Dr. Ross, advance copies of the RadiologMay issue, and other information, please contact John Lockhart oBelinda Gerber for HMRI at 310-444-7000 or 800-522-8877   Q & A on Alzheimer's Disease   What is Alzheimer's disease and how is it caused   Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable degenerative disease othe brain first described in 1906 by the German neuropathologisAlois Alzheimer.  As the disease progresses, it leads to loss omemory and mental functioning, followed by changes in personalityloss of control of bodily functions, and, eventually, death   How many people does it affect   Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 4 million adults ithe United States and is the fourth leading cause of death, takinapproximately 100,000 lives each year.  While Alzheimer'debilitates its victims, it is equally devastating, botemotionally and financially, for patients' families.  AD is thmost common cause of dementia in adults.  Symptoms worsen everyear, and death usually occurs within 10 years of initial onset   What are its signs and symptoms   Although the cause of AD is not known, two risk factors havbeen identified: advanced age and genetic predisposition.  The risof developing AD is less than one percent before the age of 5yars old, but increases steeply in each successive decade of lifto reach 30 percent by the age of 90.  In patients with familiaAD, immediate family relatives have a 50 percent chance odeveloping AD.  One of its first symptoms is severe "forgetfulnesscaused by short-term memory loss.  Dr. Herman Weinreb of the Schooof Medicine at New York University says "whether forgetfulness ia serious symptom or not is largely a matter of degree" ansuggests the following criteria   -- Forgetting the name of someone you see infrequently i      normal   -- Forgetting the name of a loved one is serious   -- Forgetting where you left your keys is normal   -- Forgetting how to get home is serious   Doctors suggest that people with severe symptoms should bevaluated in order to rule out Alzheimer's disease and other formof dementia -30-Canada Remote Systems - Toronto, Ontari416-629-7000/629-704

>>Hello, a friend is under going kemotherapy(sp?) for breast cancer. I'>trying to learn what I can about it. Any info would be appreciated>ThanksYou've asked a toughie of a question.  There are many different drugs whicare used for chemotherapyThe overall purpose of chemotherapy (don't worry about the spelling.  Some othese crazy medical words are impossible to spell! :-) is to either destrocancer cells or to keep them from growing.  Different drugs have differeneffects on cancer cells, and therefore, it is not uncommon to use more thaone drug at a timeSome chemotherapeutic drugs are effective anytime during the growth cyclof a cell.  Others work only at specific times during the cell cycleThe first phase of the cell cycle is G1; it is when the protein synthesiand RNA systhesis occurs.  In the second phase, S, synthesis of DNA occursThe third phase is G2; The DNA splits and RNA and protein are synthesizedaagain.  In the fourth phase, M (or Mitosis), the cell may divideThere are drugs which are effective in each phase.  Some stop DNA synthesisOthers stop the cell from dividing. Others wreck protein synthesisAt any rate, the end result that is being sought is for the cancer cellto stop growingIf what you are seeking is "practical" advice, I apologize for ramblinon the techno stuff.  Some side effects are pretty common.  Chemo. drugare rather nasty.  It can cause a person to lose their appetite and toexperience nausea and vomiting.  Things to help this include eating smalfrequent meals.  It is also suggested that if nausea/vomiting (hereafteknown as n/v) occurs that the person notify the doctor; there are medicinetthat help nausea.  Diarrhea can be an effect.  Antidiarrheal medicationscan be given, and good skincare and fluid intake are importantProbably the one of biggest concsern is hair loss.  This does not alwayhappen.  It depends on what drugs are being given, and on the personthemself.  Different people taking the same drug can and do have differenside effects.  I have seen some literature which states that wearing a snuheadband and/or wearing an ice cap can help reduce hair loss, presumablby reducing blood flow to the scalp.  If anyone has seen research on thitoo, I would love to see it, and possibly some bib dataI highly recommend making contact with the American Cancer SocietyThey have a vast selection of literature and information.  In additionif your friend has had a mastectomy, I highly recommend "Reach for Recovery"It is a support group comprised entirely of women who have lost a breastbecause of cancer.  They can offer some excellent support and suggestionsIf you have further questions, please send me E-mail.  I hav some gooaccess to information, and I enjoy trying to help other peopleI wish the best to you and your friend

First of all, I would want to know wh sponsored that study I have seen too many "nutrition" bulletins over the years fro local newspapers, magazines, to TV-guide, with disclaimers on th bottom informing us that this great health news was brought to u compliments of the Dairy Industries There are of course numerous other interest groups now that thriv financially on the media hype created from the supposedly enormous benefits of increasing one's calcium intake Secondly, were ALL the kidney stones of the test subjects involved in that project analysed for their chemical composition?

Guidleines have been set on the number of dental x-rays and chest x-raysthat one should have over a given period of time because of all theenvironmental factors that can cause cancer in humans, ionizing radiationis one of the most potent(splits DNA and causes hydroxyl free radicalformation in tissue cells).  Ultasound(like that used in seeing the fetusin the uterus) has been shown to be extremely good at picking up tumorsin the prostate and gallstones in the gallbladder.  But kidney tissue maybe too dense for ultrasound to work for kidney stones(any radiologists careto comment?)Most stones will pass(but it's a very painful process).  Unlike gallstones,I don\'t think that there are many drugs that can help "dissolve" thekidney stone(which is probably calcium-oxalate).  Vitamin C and magnesiumhave worked in rabbits to remove calcium from calcified plaques in theaterial wall.  I have no idea if a diet change or supplementation couldspeed up the process of kidney stone passage(but I'm pretty confident thata diet change and/or supplementation can prevent a reoccurance).  If surgeryis being contemplated, the stone must be in the kidney tubule.  A secondopinion is a good idea because there are better(less damaging) ways to breakup the stone if it's logged within the kidney(sonic blasts).  HMO's arenotorious for conservative care and long waits for expensvie treatments. My condolences to your friend.Marty B

Actually I am entering vet school next year, but the question isrelevant for med students tooMemorizing large amounts has never been my strong point academicallySince this is a major portion of medical education -- anatomy,histology, pathology, pharmacology, are for the most part massmemorization -- I am a little concerned.  As I am sure mostmed students areCan anyone suggest techniques for this type of memorization?  Ihave had reasonable success with nemonics and memory tricks likthinking up little stories to associate unrelated things.  But I havnever applied them to large amounts of "data"Has anyone had luck with any particular books, memory systems, ocheap software?  Can you suggest any helpful organizational techniques?  Being aolder student who returned to school this year, organization (anotheone of my weak points) has been a major help to my successPlease no griping about how all you have to do is "learn" the materiaconceptually.  I have no problem with that, it is one of my strongpoints.  But you can't get around the fact that much of medicine irote memorization. Thanks for your help

Some of the MD's in this newsgroup have been riding my butt pretty goo(maybe in some cases with good reason).  In this post on depression, I'mlaying it all out.  I'll continue to post here because I think that I havesome knowledge that could be useful.  Once you have read this post, youshould know where I'm coming from when I post again in the future>> A family member of mine is suffering from a severe depression brought o> by menopause as well as a mental break down.

If anyon> can suggest a Philly area nutritionist, or else some literature to read> I'd appreciate itLidaI can emphasize with your situation.  Both my wife and I suffered frombouts of depression.  Her's was brought on by breast cancer and mine was arebound stress reaction to her modified radical mastectomy andchemotherapy.  Lida, I used my knowledge of nutrition to get her throughher six months of chemotherapy(with the approval of her oncologist).  Whensevere depression set in a few months after the chemo stopped, I tried touse supplements to bring her out of it.  I had "cured" her PMS usingsupplements and I really thought that I knew enough about the role of dietin depression to take care of her depression as well.  It didn't work andshe was put on Prozac by her oncologist.  Two Winters ago(three years afterby wife's breast cancer) I got hit with severe depression(pretty typical andone reason why many marriages break up after breast cancer or anotherstressor).  I tried to take care of it for several months withsupplementation.  Didn't work.  My internist ended up putting me on Prozac.I was going to give you a list of several studies that have been done usingB6, niacin, folate and B12 to "cure" depression.  I\'m not going to do thatbecause all you would be doing is flying blind like I wasLida, I do believe that depression can have a dietary component.  But theproblem is that you need to know exactly what the problem is and then usean approach which will "fix" the problem.  For chemotherapy, I knew exactlywhat drugs were going to be used and exactly what nutrients would beaffected.  Same thing for PMS.  I was flying blind for both of thesestressors but the literature that I used to devise a treatment program waspretty good.  Depression is just too complicated.  What you really need isa nutritional scan.  This is not a diet analysis but an analysis of yourbodies nutrient reserves.  For every vitamin and mineral(except vitamin C),you have a reserve.  The RDA is not designed to give you enough of anynutrient to keep these reserves full, it is only designed to keep them frombeing emptied which would cause clinical pathology.  Stress will increaseyour need for many vitamins and minerals.  This is when your reserves becomevery importantLida, without your permission, I'm going to use your post as a conduit totry to explain to the readers in this group and Sci. Med. where I'm comingfrom.  I have taught a course on human nutrition in one of the OsteopathicMedical schools for ten years now.  I've written my own textbook becausenone was available.  What I teach is not a rehash of biochemistry.  Ipreach nutrient reserves(yes my lectures in this course are referred to bymy students as sermons).

I last did thisin the Summer of 1991.  I read everything that I can find and then sit downand rewrite my lecture handouts which are bound in three separate booksthat have 217, 237 and 122 pages.  Opposite each page of written text(whichI write myself) I've pulled figures, tables and graphs from variouscopyrighted sources.  Since this material is only being used foreducational purposes, I can get around the copyright laws (so far).  I can notsend this material out to newsgroup readers(as I've been asked to do)I am now in the process of trying to get a grant to setup a nutritionassessment lab.  This is the last peice of the nutrition puzzle that I needto make my education program complete.  This lab will let me measure thenutrient reserve for almost all the vitamins and minerals that are known tobe required in humans.  The Mayo clinic already uses a similiar lab todesign supplement programs for their cancer patients.  Cancer TreatmentCenters of America, which is a private for-profit organization withhospitals in Illinois and Oklahoma(Tulsa) also operates anutritional assessment clinical lab.  I also believe that the PritikinClinic in California has a similiar lab setupFor physicians reading this post, I would suggest that you get the newClinical Nutrition Textbook that has just been published(Feb) by Mosby.  Ihave been using Alpers Manual of Nutritional Therapeutics(a Little Brownseries book) as a supplemental text for my course but Alpers is geared moreto residency training.  Two M.D's have written this new Clinical Nutritiotextbook and it is geared more towards medical student education and itdoes a good job of covering the lab tests that can be run to assess apatient's nutritional status.  Let me quote a few sentences from thePreface of this new text"So-called nutrition specialists were in reality gastroenterologists,hematologists, or pediatricians who just happened to profess some knowledgeof nutrition as it related to their field of practice." "Unfortunately, about two thirds of the medical schools in the UnitedStates require no formal instruction in nutrition."But times and medical practice have changed.  More than half of theleading causes of death in this country are nutrition related."... this monograph should accomplish the following two objectives: (1) itshould complement your medical training by emphasizing the relevance ofnutrition to your medical practice; and (2) it should heighten yourawareness of nutrition as a medical speciality that is vitally importantfor both disease prevention and the treatment of diseases of essentiallyevery organ system.Roland L. Weinsier, MD, DrPHLida, my advise to you is that you tell your family members to try to finda physician who has an understanding of the role that vitamins and mineral(yes even magnesium may play a role in depression) play in depression andwho could get a nutritional profile run.  Menopause is often a time whenwomen suffer depression.  There are a lot of hormonal changes that areoccuring but they are not the same ones that occur during PMS.  Anutritionist may also be able to help.  Not too long ago a poster mentionedthat his nutritionist had diagnosed a selenium deficiency based on a redcell glutathionine peroxidase test(the specific test for the seleniumreserve).  Most clinical labs will not run this test and I advised him totry to make sure that the lab that did the test was certified.  There arealso a lot of hair and nail analysis labs setup to do trace mineralanalysis but these labs are not regulated.  Checks of these labs usingcertified standards, and also those doing water lead analysis, showed somepretty shoddy testing was going on.  If you or anyone else finds someonewho will run these speciality nutrition tests, make sure that they areusing a lab that has been certified under CLIA(the Clinical LaboratoryImprovement Act). A diet analysis may be helpful since many nutrient reserves have been shownto correlate fairly well with the dietary intake as monitored by food loggingand software analysis(Nutritionist IV and other software programs).  Butthere are still about half of the nutrients required by humans that do notshow a very good correlation between apparent dietary intake and reserve statusUntil we have more nutritional assessment clinical labs in operation in theU.S. and physicians who have been trained how to use the nutritionalprofile that these labs provide to devise a treatment approach that usesdiet changes and supplementation, anti-depressants will probably continueto be the best approach to depressionMartin Banschbach, Ph.DProfessor of Biochemistry and ChairmaDepartment of Biochemistry and MicrobiologOSU College of Osteopathic Medicin"Without discourse, there is no remembering, without remembering, there isno learning, without learning, there is only ignorance.

Hi StepheEar wax is a healthy way to help prevent ear infections, both by preventina barrier and also with some antibiotic properties.  Too much can block thexternal auditory canal (the hole in the outside of the ear) and cause somehearing problems.  It is very simple, and safe, to remove excess wax on youown, or at your physician's office.  You can take a syringe (no needles!) anfill it with 50% warm water (cold can cause fainting) and 50% OTC hydrogeperoxide.  Then point the ear towards the ceiling ( about 45 degrees upand insert the tip of the syringe (helps to have someone else do this!) and firmly expell the solution.  Depending on the size of the syringe and thtenacity of the wax, this could take several rinses.  If you place a bowlunder the ear to catch the water, it will be much drier :-).  You can bua syringe with a special tip at your local pharmacy, or just use whateveyou may have.  If wax is old, it will be harder, and darker.  You can tradding a few drops of olive oil into the ear during a shower to soften uthe wax.  Do this for a couple days, then try syringing again.  It is alssafe to point your ear up at the shower head, and allow the water to rinsit outGood Luc-heathe

Not all kidney stones have calcium and notall calcium stones are calcium-oxalate.  But the vast majority are calciumoxalate.  Calcium is just one piece of the puzzle.  I cited that NEJM articleas a way of pointing out to some of the physicians in this group thatconventional wisdom is used in medicine, always has been and probablyalways will be.  If one uses conventional wisdom, there is a chance thatyou will be wrong.  As long as the error is not going to cause a lot ofdamage, what's the big deal(why call a physician who gives anti-fungals tosinus suffers or GI distress patients a quack?)On the kidney stone problem.  I'd want a mineral profile run in a clinicalchemistry lab.  Balance is much more important than the dietary intake ofcalcium.  I know that you use an electrical conductance technique tomeasure mineral balance in the body.  I know that you don't think that theserum levels for minerals are very useful(I agree).  If I can get a goodnutritional assessment lab setup where I can actually measure the tissuereserve for minerals, I'd like to do a collaborative study with you to seehow your technique compares with mineMarty B

But before I do, I want toget a few things off my chest.  I just got blasted in e-mail for my kidneystone posts.  Kidney stones are primarily caused by diet, as is heartdisease and cancer.  When I give dietary advise, it is not intended toencourage people reading this news group(or Sci. Med. Nutrition where I domost of my posting) to avoid seeing a doctor.  Nothing can be further fromthe truth.  Kidney stones can be caused by tumors and this possibility has tobe ruled out.  But once it is, diet is a good way of preventing a reoccuranceSame thing with heart disease and cancer, if you suspect that you may havea problem with one of these diseases, don't use what I'm going to tell youor what you read in some book to avoid going to a doctor.  You have to goHopefully you will find a doctor who knows enough about nutrition to helpyou change your risk factors for both diseases as part of a treatmentprogram(but the odds are that you will not and that's why I'm here).  Whenmy wife detected a lump in here breast I didn't say, don't worry my vitaminE will take care of it.  Any breast lump has to be worked up by a physician,plan and simple.  If it's begnin(which most are) fine, then maybe a dietchange and supplementation will prevent further breast lumps from occuringBut let me tell you right now, if you have tried diet and supplementationand another lump returns, get your butt into the doctor's office as fast asyour little feet can carry you(better yet, have a mammography done on aregular basis, my wife kept putting her's off, both myself and hergynocologist told her she needed to have one done).  Her gynocologist evenscheduled one, but she didn't show up(too busy running the Operating Room forthe biggest Hospital in Tulsa)One more thing, I am not an orthomolecular nutritionist.  This group useshigh dose vitamins and minerals to treat all kinds of disease.  There isabsolutely no doubt in my mind that vitamins and minerals can and do havedrug actions in the body.  But you talk about flying blind, man this isreally blind treatment.  No drug could ever be used as these vitamins andminerals are being used.  I'm not saying that some of this stuff couldn'tbe right on the money, it may well be.  But my approach to nutrition is alot like that of Weinsier and Morgan, the two M.D's who wrote the newClinical Nutrition textbook.  My push is the nutrient reserves and the labtests needed to measure these reserves and then supplementation or dietchanges to get these reserves built up to where they should be to let youhandle stress.  That's where I'm coming from folks.  Blast away if you wantI'm not going to change.  Put me in your killfile if you want, I reallydon't care.  I'm averaging 8-10 e-mail messages a day from people who thinkthat I've got something important to say.  But I'm also getting hit by afew with an axe to grind.  That's lifeChromium is one of the trace elements.  It has a very limited(but veryimportant) role in the body.  It is used to form glucose tolerance facto(GTF).  GTF is made up of chromium, nicinamide(niacin), glycine, cysteineand glutamic.  Only the chromium and the niacin are needed from the diet toform GTF.  Some foods already have GTF(Liver, brewers or nutritional yeastand black pepper).  When chromium is in GTF, a pretty good absorption isseen(about 20%).  But when it is simply present as a mineral or mineralchelate(chromium picolinate) it's absorption is much lower(1 to 2%, lowestfor all the minerals).  I've been posting in Misc. Fitness and chromium hascome up there several times as a "fat burner".  Chromium is among the leasttoxic of the minerals so you could really load yourself up and not reallydo any harm.  I wouldn't do it though.  The adequate and safe range forchromium is 50 to 200ug per day.  The average American is getting about30ug per day from his/her diet.  Chromium levels decrease with age and manybelieve that adult onset diabetes is primarily a chromium deficiency.  Ican cite you several studies that have been done with glucose tolerance inType II diabetes but I'm not going to because for each positive one, therealso seems to be a negative one as well.  I'm convinced that the problem isbioavailability.  When yeast(GTF) is used, good results are obtained but whenchromium itself is used the results are usually negative.  In addition toType II diabetes, chromiuum has been examined in cardiovascular disease andglucoma, again with mixed results as far as cardiovascular disease isconcerneSince a high blood glucose level can lead to cardiovascular disease,this possible link with chromium isn't too surprising.  Glucoma is a littlemore interesting.  Muscle eye focusing activity is primarily an insulinresponsive glucose-driven metabolic function.  If this eye focusing activityis impaired(by a lack of glucose due to a poor insulin response), intraocularpressure is believed to be elevated.  In a fairly large study of 400 pts withglaucoma, the one consistent finding was a low RBC chromium. J. Am. Coll.Nutr. 10(5):536,(1991).  But this one preliminary study should not promptpeople to go out and start popping chromium supplements.  For one thing,just about every older person is going to have a low RBC chromium unlessthey have been taking chromium suppleemnts(yeast).  Since glucoma is oftenfound in older people, it's not too surprising that chromium was low in theRBC's.  If chromium supplementation could reverse glucoma, that wouldprompt some attention.  I suspect that there will be a clinical trail tocheck out this possible chromium link to glucomaYou could find out what your body chromium pool size was by either the RBCchromium test or hair analysis.  Most clinical labs are not going to run aRBC chromium.  There are plenty of labs that will do a hair and nailanalysis for you, but I wouldn't use them.  There is just too much funnybusiness going on in these unregulated labs right nowHere's Weinsier and Morgan, advise on chromium.  They do not considerchromium to be one of those minerals for which a reliable clinical test isavailable(they don't like the hair and nail analysis labs either, and theyalso recognize the RBC chromium is primarily a research test that is notroutinely available in most clinical chemistry labs).  This has to changeand as more labs run a RBC chromiuum, it will.  What then do they suggestMake a diagnosis of chromium deficiency based on a documented clinicalresponse to chromium(run a glucose tolerance test before and after chromiumsupplementation).  Once you make the diagnosis, put the patient on 200ug ofCrCl3 orally each day or 10grams of yeast per dayWhat's my advise?  Don't take chromium supplements to try to loose weigh(they just do not work that way).  If you want to take them and thenexercise, that would be great.  Do include yeast as part of your diet(mostAmericans are not getting enough chromium from their diet).  If you do havea poor glucose tolerance, ask your doctor to check your chromium status. When he or she says, "what in the world are you talking about", just say,please get a copy of Weinsier and Morgan's new Clinical Nutrition textbookand do what they say to do with patients who present with a poor glucosetolerance.  If you can't do that, I'll find a doctor who can, thank youvery muchMarty B

  There is no data to show chromium is effective in promoting weight loss.  Th few studies that have been done using chromium have been very flawed and inheently biased (the investigators were making money from marketing it)  Theoretically it really doesnt make sense either. The claim is that chromiuwill increase muscle mass and decrease fat.  Of course, chromium is also used o cure diabetes, high blood pressure and increase muscle mass in athletes(jusas well as anabolic steroids). Sounds like snake oil for the 1990's :- On the other hand, it really cant hurt you anywhere but your wallet, and placbo effects of anything can be pretty dramatic..                                    -Pau     ---------------------------------------------------------    |  Paul Sovcik, Pharm.D.

What does this have to do with how wel> nutrition is taught, anywayElisabeth, let's set the record straight for the nth time, I have not read"The Yeast Connection".  So anything that I say is not due to brainwashingby this "hated" book.  It\'s okay I guess to hate the book, by why hate meElisabeth, I'm going to quote from Zinsser's Microbiology, 20th EditionA book that you should be familiar with and not "hate". "Candida speciescolonize the mucosal surfaces of all humans during birth or shortlythereafter.  The risk of endogenous infection is clearly ever present. Indeed, candidiasis occurs worldwide and is the most common systemicmycosis."  Neutrophils play the main role in preventing a systemicinfection(candidiasis) so you would have to have a low neutrophil count or"sick" neutrophils to see a systemic infection.  Poor diet and persistentparasitic infestation set many third world residents up for candidiasisYour assessment of candidiasis in the U.S. is correct and I do not disputeitWhat I posted was a discussion of candida blooms, without systemicinfection.  These blooms would be responsible for local sites of irritatio(GI tract, mouth, vagina and sinus cavity).  Knocking down the bacterialcompetition for candida was proposed as a possible trigger for candidablooms.  Let me quote from Zinsser\'s again: "However, some factors, such asthe use of a broad-spectrum antibacterial antibiotic, may predispose toboth mucosal and systemic infections".  I was addressing mucosal infection(I like the term blooms better).  The nutrition course that I teach coversthis effect of antibiotic treatment as well as the "cure".  I guess thatyour nutrition course does not, too bad. >>Here is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly>>called, are not truely caused by yeasts.

(shudder> Or maybe you did know, and were oversimplifyingMy, my Elisabeth, do I detect a little of Steve Dyer in you?  If younoticed my faculty rank, I'm a biochemist, not a microbiologistCandida is classifed as a fungus(according to Zinsser's).  But, as you pointout, it displays dimorphism.  It is capable of producing yeast cells,pseudohyphae and true hyphae.  Elisabeth, you are probably a microbiologistand that makes a lot of sense to you.  To a biochemist, it's a lot ofGreek.  So I called it a yeast-like fungus, go ahead and crucify meYou know Elisabeth, I still haven't been able to figure out why such a smalllittle organism like Candida can bring out so much hostility in people inSci. Med.  And I must admitt that I got sucked into the mud slinging tooI keep hoping that if people will just take the time to think about whatI've said, that it will make sense.  I'm not asking anyone here to buy into"The Yeast Connection" book because I don\'t know what\'s in that book, plainand simple.

[Some kinds might work better that others.               (2) Divide the sample into two groups of equal weight                   and number               (3) Sprout one group in distilled water on filter paper                   for three or four weeks               (4) Separately incinerate both groups               (5) Weigh the residue from each group.  [The residue of                   the sprouted group will usually weigh at least                   SEVERAL PERCENT MORE than the other group.               (6) Analyze quantitatively the residue of each group for                   mineral content.  [Some of the mineral atoms of the                   sprouted group have been TRANSMUTED into heavier                   mineral elements by FUSING with atoms of oxygen,                   hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, etc..                        BIOLOGICAL TRANSMUTATIONS occur ROUTINELY, even in our          own bodies.                        Ingesting a source of organic silicon (silicon with          carbon, such as "horsetail" extract, or radishes) can SPEED          HEALING OF BROKEN BONES via the reaction Si + C --> Ca, (much          faster than by merely ingesting the calcium directly).                         Some MINERAL DEPOSITS in the ground are formed by micro          organisms FUSING together atoms of silicon, carbon, nitrogen,          oxygen, hydrogen, etc..                        The two reactions Si + C <--> Ca, by micro-organisms,          cause "STONE SICKNESS" in statues, building bricks, etc..                         The reaction N2 --> CO, catalysed by very hot iron,          creates a CARBON-MONOXIDE POISON HAZARD for welder operators          and people near woodstoves (even properly sealed ones).

>...I\'m not asking anyone here to buy into "The Yeast Connection" boo>because I don't know what's in that book, plain and simple. And to be hones>with you, I'm beginning to wish that it was never writtenI agree with this consensus that it should not have been written the wait was.  My doctor - who claims to have introduced Dr. Crook to thpossibility of candida overbloom causing diffuse symptoms way back i1961 (I have no reason to doubt him on this) - does not like the boobecause 1) it makes too many unfounded claims, and 2) is horribly writtefrom a scientific viewpoint.  On the other hand, my doctor has always kepan open mind on the subject and does believe in aspects of the "yeasconnection"But, I believe there is some truth to the book.  Hopefully the righclinical studies can be done to separate the fact from the fiction.  Ithe meantime, I\'d still encourage people who have "incurable" chronic sinuproblems (especially if they overused antibiotics), to find a doctor tadminister a systemic-type anti-fungal such as itraconazole (along witliver panels before, during and after treatment just to play it safe).  Iis an empirical approach for sure, but when all else fails, and your ENsays "sorry, you\'ll just have to live with it", it is time to step out antry an empirical approach backed up with significant anecdotal evidenc(Dr. Ivker), supported by plausible theories (outlined by Marty).  Athis stage you have little to lose, particularly if you use itraconazole anhave the proper monitoring - the health risk has been shown through extensivclinical studies both in Europe and the U.S. to be very minimal witrelatively healthy (i.e., non-AIDS) patients.  I'm glad I did this, since saw remarkable results after only one week on Sporanox (itraconazole).  Ocourse, your mileage may vary a lot - everyone is different so it may nowork for you.

I was just wondeing, since you mentioned thhat she has aoncologistA bone scan is a nuclear scan.  Thperson receivving the scan is gven dose of a radioactive tracer, and an imaging device is used to track thdistribution of the tracer wwithin the body.  The tracer is usually giveintravenously.  (IV) This means that the physician or his assistant wilinsert a needle into a vein and inject  medicine into the vein.After a few minutes has passed for the tracer to circulate through thbody, the person is scanned with an imaging device to detect highconcentrations of the tracer.  The radiologist or doctor is looking foareas that take up more of the radioactive tracer or less of itAs far as pain, the only pain comes from the needle stick that is requireto start the IV lineWhat the doctor is probably looking for are changes in the bones that mahave resulted from cancer.  This is also why I was wondering if your mothehas had cancer, since cancer can spread from one site and wind up in thskeletal systemI hope I have answered some of your questions.

\tFor a very long time I've had a problem with feeling really awfuwhen I try to get up in the morning.  My sleep latency at night is alspretty long,  ranging from 30 min to an hour.  I get about 7 hours obedtime (maybe 6 of actual sleep) a night and more on the weekends.  will spend two or three hours laying in bed after this if I can,  becausI feel so tired when I wake up,  even more tired than I was when went to bed,  which is usually too tired to work\tAnyway,  I recently had a really bad flu,  so I called a friend tget me some cough syrup with both an expectorant and a nasal decongestantbut he got Vicks formula 44M which has everything but an expectorant.  SI used that anyway,  and the three nights I used it,  I fell asleep rapidland felt that I got really good quality sleep -- that is,  I actuallfelt refreshed the next morning\tSo,  I am now trying to look into,  both in the literature anexperimentally,  the use of antihistamines as sleep aids,  since I apresuming that it was the antihistamine that caused the effect.  Thantihistamine in Vicks formula 44 is Chloriphenamine maleate,  so I boughsome generic tablets of that,  and tried one last night and didn'notice any improvement.  I might try one with a little alcohol (abou1 beer) to see if it is a synergism effect.  Also,  library researcseems to show that Benadryl is the antihistamine with the strongessedative effect of what is availible OTC.  So I might also buy a generiform of that and try that;  the PDR seems to suggest that 50 mg is a goodosage level to try\tFor other medical information,  I have allergies but rarely havan allergic reaction living in New Mexico.  I also have chronically dreyes,  which get horrible if I try to use most underarm deoderants.  I diguess that my problem might be caused by hypoglycemia,  so I made somchanges in my diet consistent with that,  and it didn't help,  so went back to a normal diet (Pretty diverse,  also taking vitamin supplements\tAnyway,  I am looking for advice for the use oantihistamines as sleep aids,  and if there are any dangers of such us(Seems safe to me since they are used chronically for allergies bmillions).  I don't want to try BZs,  because BZ addiction seems to ba serious threat,  and from what I hear,  BZ sleep quality is not goodwhereas antihistamine sleep quality seems to be better for me.

She has been to a doctor and taken the ordinary (?tests and her values were regarded as low. The doctor (and my wife) arnot very interested in starting medication as this "deactivates" thegland, giving life-long dependency to the drug (hormone?). The last couple ofmonthes she has been seeing a hoemoepath (sp?) and been givesome drops to re-activate either her thyroidal gland and/or the'message-center' in the brain (sorry about the approximate languagebut I haven't got many clues to what the english terms are, but thebrain-area is called the 'hypofyse' in norwegian.)My questions are: has anyone had/heard of success in using this approachHer values have been (slowly but) steadily sinking, any comment on thprobability of improvement? Although the doctor has told her to 'eanormally', my wife has dieted vigorously to keep her weight as she feelthat is part of keeping an edge over the illness/condition, may thiaffect the treatment, developmentI can get the exact figures for her tests for anyone interested, and will greatly value any information/opinion/experience on this topicI don't intend this post to be either a flaming of the establishemedical profession or a praise for alternatives, I am just relayinevents as they have happenedSincerelyErik A.

A friend was recently admitted to North Carolina Memorial Hospitabecause of suspected meningitis.  Serious business.  They wanted to da lumbar puncture, for which a CT scan is a prerequisiteI arrived in her hospital room about an hour after she had returnefrom the CT.   She was in tears.  Evidently the technicians in the Clab had been very unpleasant to herTo begin with, they put her on the apparatus that moves you into thmachine itself, and just pushed a button to slide her straight into thmachine, without any explanation.  Imagine this.  You worried you mahave a deadly disease, and next thing you know you're being put intthis big scary machine, without a word of explanation about what igoing to happen to you.  I believe this is inexcusable.   She waved hehand as if to say what are you doing to me, and they responded witannoyance and anger.  Next they inserted, or tried to insert, an Icatheter.  Apparently she has a lot of trouble with these and complaineof the pain.  The technician just stopped and fixed her with a glarwithout any words of explanationIs there anything I can do about these pigs I realize that these technicians do this sort of job day in and daout.  And that some patients can be very irritating and uncooperativeBut this is simply no excuse.  Their purpose for existing is to helsick people, and there is no excuse for this sort of behaviorFortunately my friend is fine.  But I imagine a large proportion of thpeople who get CT scans are not fine at all.  They have cancer and thasort of thing.  They don't need this kind of shitAlso, since I named the hospital involved, I should also point out thaneither she nor I have any complaints about the competence or compassioof any of the other personnel at NCMHThanks for listeningJohn Eylejge@cs.unc.ed

RobertI'm *so* glad that you posted your Biological Alchemy discussion.  I'vebeen compared to the famous Robert McElwaine by some readers of Sci. MedI didn't know how to respond since I had not seen one of your posts(justlike I haven\'t read "The Yeast Connection")Let me just start by stating that the authors of the "Cold Fusion" papers ofrecent years are now in scientific exile(I believe that one has actuallyleft the country).  Scientific fraud is rare.  I'm still not sure that if areview of the research notes of the "cold fusion scientists" actuallyproved fraud or just very shoddy experimentationYour sources do not seem to be research articles.  They are more like laytexts designed to pique human interest in a subject area(just like the foodcombining and life extension texts).  Robert, I try to keep an open mindBut some things I just can't buy(one is taking SOD orally to preventoxidative damage in the body)Your experiment, if conducted by readers of this news group, would provethat you are right(more ash after seed sprouting than before).  Unless youuse a muffle furnance and obtain a very high temperature(above 600 degreesI believe), you will get organic residue in the ash.  Even the residue incommercial incinerators contains organic residue.  I remember doing thiskind of experiment in my organic chemistry couurse in College but Icouldn't find a temperature for mineral ash formation so I'm reallyguessing at 600 degrees F, it may actually be much higher.  The point isthat no one in their home could ever get a high enough temperature toproduce *only* a mineral ash.  They also could not measure the minerals sothey could only weigh the ash and find out that you appear to be correct.Chemical reactions abound in our body, in our atmosphere, in our water andin our soil.  Are these fusion reactions?  Yes many of them do involvefusing oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur to both organics and inorganics.  Do wereally have the transformation of silicone to calcium if carbon is fused withsilicon?  Not in my book RobertSilicon is the most abundant mineral on our planet.  I've seen speculationthat man could have evolved to be a silicon based rather than a carbonbased life-form.  I like reading science fiction, as many people do.  But Iknow enough about biochemistry(and nutrition) to be able(in most cases) toseparate the fiction from the factSilicon may be one of the trace elements that turns out to be essential inhumans.  We have several grams of the stuff in our body.  What's it doingthere?  Only the Lord knows right now.  But I will tell you what I do knowabout silicon and why, as you state, it helps bone healing(and it is notbecause silicon is transformed into calcium)Almost all of the silicon in the human body is found in the connectivetissue(collagen and elastin).  There have been studies published which showthat the very high silicon content in elastin may be an important protectivefactor against atherosclerosis(the higher the silicon content in elastin,the more resistant the elastin is to a an age-related loss of elasticitywhich may play a role in the increase in blood pressure that is often seen aspart of the ageing process in humans)For bone fracture healing, the first step is a collagen matrix into whichcalcium and phosphate are pumped by osteoblasts.  A high level of siliconin the diet seems to speed up this matrix formation.  This first step in thebone healing process seems to be the hardest for some people to get goingElectriacl currents have been used in an attempt to get the matrix formingcells oriented in the right direction so that the matrix can be formed inthe gap(or gaps) between the ends of the broken bone.  A vitamin C deficienc(by slowing collagen formation as well as causing the prodcution ofdefective collagen) does slow down both bone and wound healing.  Zinc is alsoanother big player in bone and wound healing.  And so is silicon(in an undetermined role that most likely involes matrix formation and nottransformation of silicon to calcium).  For you to take this bone healingobservation and use it as proof that silicon is transformed intocalcium is an interesting little trickBut Robert, I have the same problem myself when I read the lay press(andyes even some scientific papers).  Is the explanation reasonable?  Withouta very good science knowledge base, you and most readers of this news groupare flying blind(you have to take it on faith because you don't know anybetter)If the explanation seems to make sense to me based on my knowledge base,I'm inclined to consider it(this usually means trying to find other sourcesthat come to the same conclusion).  If the idea(like a candida bloom) seemsto make sense to me, I tend to pursue it as long as any advice that I'mgoing to give isn't going to really mess somebody up.  If this makes uskindred souls Robert, then I guess I'll have to live with that labelFor the physicians who have decided to read my response to Robert'sinteresting post, I hope that you saw the segment on the pediatricneurosurgeon last night on U.S. TV.  I can't remember the network or hisname(like many nights, I was on my computer and my wife was watching TV inour Den where I have my computer setup).  This neurosurgeon takes kids withbrain tumors that everyone else has given up on and he uses"unconventionaltreatments(his own words).  He says that he has a 70% success rate.  The onecase that I heard him discussing would normally use radiation(conventionaltreatment).  He was going to go in and cut.  You guys complain about thecost of the anti-fungals.  What do you think the cost difference betweenradiation treatment and surgery is guys?I'm going to ask you guys one more time, why blast a physician who takes thechronic sinus sufferer(like Jon) and the chronic GI sufferer(like Elaineand tries to help them using unconventional treatments?  Treatments whichdo not result in death(like those that the neurosurgeon uses?).  Is itbecause candida blooms are not life-threatening while brain tumors areHow about quality of life guys?  May the candida demon never cross yoursinus cavity or gut(if it does, you may feel differently about the issue)Marty B

People with early life herniaare felt to have a congenital sack that promotes the formation of herniasThe hernias of later life may be more associated with chronic straining. However, the risk of damage to the intestine without an operation ishigh enough that it ought to be repaired.  The risk of cancer is probablno higher than the general population, but since you are near 40, it woulbe sensible to have some sort of cancer screening, such as a flexiblsigmoidoscopy.

Except for ones caused by infections, the treatment igenerally thyroxin pills. Hypothyroid conditions caused by infectionusually disappear when the infection does...this doesn't sound like thcase with your wifeThyroxin orally does "shut down the thyroid" through a feedback looinvolving the pituitary (I believe). The pituitary "thinks" that thcorrect amount of thyroxin is being produced so it doesn't have ttell the thyroid to produce more. This process is reversable! I havHashimoto's thyroiditis (an autoimmune condition) and was on thyroxifor approx 6 mo when my endocrinologist suggested I not take the pillfor 6 wks. When I was retested for thyroxin levels, they were normalI still get tested every 6mo because the condition might reappearThe pills are safe and have very few side-affects (& those mostly abeginning of treatment). Having a baby might be a problem and would aleast require closer monitoring of hormone levelsThyroxin controls energy production which explains sleepiness, coldnessand weight gain. There is also water retention (possibly around heart)changes in vision, and coarser hair and skin among other thingsI am not a doctor, so I'm sure I mistated something, but the importanthing is that thyroid problems are usually easily corrected and if thearen't corrected can cause problems in the rest of the body. Get second opinion from a good endocrinologist and have him/her explaithings in detail to you and your wife- Eileen Baue

I've sent Gordon R. my posts on protein, vitamin C and vitamin A prior toposting on internet as a professional courtesy.  Somehow I've managed todelete my vitamin A post from my text file.  Gordon R. had promised to sendit back to me but he's pretty mad at me right now so I'll just retype itSince digging through all my references is very time consuming(took me allday for that PMS post), I'm not going to cite any references(Gordon R. hasthem).  I'm going to include some of the material from Weinsier andMorgan's new Nutrition textbook(which was not in my original material) topoint out that what I'm going to say has some support in the medicalcommunityDiet has been know to affect the immune system of man for a very, very longtime.  Protein has always had the biggest role in infection and I'vealready covered the role of protein in protecting you against infectionNow I'm going to hit what I consider to be the most important nutrient inthe U.S. as far as infection is concerned(vitamin A)When vitamin A was originally discovered, it was commonly referred to asthe anti-infection vitamin.  Many people(Linus Pauling being one) havedecided to take this title away from vitamin A and give it to vitamin (which I've already covered).  Big mistake(in my opinion).  Vitamin A isalso getting a reputation as an anti-cancer vitamin(with good reason)The NCI currently has numerous clinical trials in progress to see ifvitamin A can not only prevent cancer but cure it as well.  It's role inboth cancer and infection is almost identical(but not quite)Vitamin A comes in two completely different forms(retinol andbeta-carotene).  Retinol is the animal form and it's toxic, beta-caroteneis the plant form and it's completely nontoxic.  Both retinol and betacarotene display good absorption in the human gut if bile is presen(60-80%).  The liver stores all of your retinol and doles it out for othertissues to use by synthesizing retinol binding protein(RBP).  A normal humanadult liver should have 500,000IU to 1,000,000IU of retinol stored.  Weare born with 10,000IU in our liver.  U.S. autopsy has shown that about30% of Americans die with the same(or less) amount of vitamin A as theywere born with.  If you don't believe that nutritional reserves(like thatof retinol in the liver) are important, then this low vitamin A reserve isnot going to affect you.  But if you believe(like I do) that the nutrientreserves are important, then there is a problem with vitamin A in the U.SThe U.S. RDA for vitamin A in an adult male is 1,000 RE or 5,000IU ofvitamin A.  For adult feamles its 800 RE or 4,000IU of vitamin A.  Dietsurveys show that most Americans are getting this amount of vitamin (either retinol or Beta-carotene) from their diet.  But the NRC(NationalResearch Council) was going to release a new RDA table in 1985 that had theRDA for both vitamin A and vitamin C raised(C to 90mg per day and A to7,500IU per day for adult males).  That report and it's recommendations waskilled.  Why? Concern over the increasing supplementation was the mainreason.  RDAs are set to prevent clinical disease, not to keep nutrientreserves full.  Many scientist in the U.S. feel that the time has come tomove away from the prevention of clinical pathology concept and movetowards the promotion of optimum health concept, especially since we havesome very good data now that show that nutrient reserves are extremelyimportant during periods of stress.  The nutritonal concervatives won thatbattle and a new group of scientist were collected to come out with the1989 RDA list which lowered the RDA for several nutrients and moved thedietary guidelines back to where they were when we first started in the1940's(get enough to prevent clinical pathology, but not enough to fillthe reserves)We know from autopsy that only about 10% of Americans have a liver with anormal vitamin A reserve(500,000IU to 1,000,000IU).  I preach nutrientreserves to my students and tell them to measure them in their patientsBut for vitamin A, only a liver biopsy(or autopsy data) will tell you howmuch somebody has stored.  We can tell very easily if someone hasoverfilled his or her liver with vitamin A by measuring the serium retinollevel(levels above 450ug/dl are highly suggestive that you have filled yourliver with vitamin A and it's time to stop taking retinol).  The normalrange of serum retinol will be 20-100ug/dl.  Hypervitaminosis A isdiagnosed with a serum retinol level of 2,000ug/dl or higher(Interpretationof Diagnostic Test, Wallach, M.D., a Little Brown Series book).  This levelof vitamin A in blood means that medical attention is necessary due tovitamin A toxicity.  Weinsier and Morgan take a much more conservativeapproach to vitamin A toxicity than does Wallach, as you will see later inthis post.  Between 450ug/dl and 2,000ug/dl you should have plentyof warning that it's time to eliminate the retinol from your diet(headache,redness of the skin, hair loss, joint pain)I tell all my students that will use vitamin A in their practice that theyhad better monitor the serum retinol level and stop when there are clearsigns that the liver is full.  You will never really know if the patientneeds the vitamin A(because you can not measure the pool in liver) but youwill always know when it's time to stop(just like in those vitamin A forPMS studies)Beta-carotene can be taken to fill up your liver with retinol and you willnever have to worry about toxicity because the conversion of beta-carotene toretinol that occurs in both your gut and your liver will slow down(stops in theliver and slows down in the gut) when your liver is full of retinol.  Buttaking Beta-carotene as the source of retinol takes a very long time tofill the liver up(I've seen estimates of 20-30 years) if you are in the 30%that only has as much as you were born with in your liver(10,000IU).  Oneother problem with beta-carotene, if you have a zinc deficit, you will notconvert as much beta-carotene to retinol in the gut or the liver because theenxzyme that does this conversion requires zinc.  In addition, the release ofretinol from the liver is a zinc dependent process so a zinc deficit willcause a vitamin A deficit even if your liver has plenty of vitamin ANow what does vitamin A do in cancer and infection protection?  The bodyuses vitamin A(retinol) for many different things.  Vision(the first to benailed down and where you see overt clinical pathology) uses the aldehyd(retinal) and alcohol(retinol) form of vitamin A.  Reproduction uses theretinol form  and some retinal.  Infection and cancer protection usesretinoic acid.  How do you convert retinol(which your white blood cellsand the mucosal cells get from blood) to retinoic acid?  You use enzymes,one of which requires vitamin C(this is why Pauling has tried to pull thetitle of anti-infection vitamin away from vitamin A).  Vitamin C does playa role in infection(interferon production for example) but it's biggest roleis the conversion of retinol to retinoic acid.  If you increase your intakeof vitamin C, you will increase your formation of retinoic acid.  Butretinoic acid can not be converted back to retinol(as retinal can) and onceit's formed, it's used and then lost to the body.  This is why the 1985 NRCgroup wanted to increase both vitamin C and vitamin A RDA'sMost people taking large amounts of vitamin C really think that they arehelping themselves.  If they don't have much vitamin A in their liver andthey are not also increasing their intake of vitamin A, they actually dothemselves more harm than goodRetinoic acid functions in white blood cells to promote antibody formationIn the mucus membrane, it is the main factor in promoting good mucusproduction and a good epithelial cell barrier to prevent infectious agents fromentering the blood system.  The mucus membrane is referred to as the "firstline" defense against infection.  For cancer, retinoic acid has been shownto act as a cell brake(it counteracts the effect of cell promoters whichstimulate cells to divide).  Cancer has two distinct steps, DNA alterationand cell promotion.  For cells that normally divide all the time, promotersare not that important.  But for lung and breast tissue which does notnormally divide, promoters are real important in the malignant processThis is the major reason why the NCI has so many different clinical trialsin progress using retinol and/or beta-caroteneChronic infection(irritation) of the mucus membranes is a signal thatvitamin A may not be adequate.  I tell my students that any patient whowalks into their office with a complaint of chronic infection has to beworked up for vitamin A(along with the other factors that medicine alreadyhas on it's list of causes for chronic infection).  I drive this home in mycourse at the Osteopathic College in Tulsa, when I teach at the allopathicmedical school in Tulsa(OU's branch campus) and when I give CME lecturesDark adaptation is the best clinical test for vitamin A status since nightvision is impacted when liver reverves drop to 50,000IU of retinol.  Theserum level of retinol can also be used, but it does not drop until liverreserves drop below 10,000 to 20,000IU.  Asking a patient if they havetrouble seeing at night is a good initial screen(if cataracts are ruledout).  In one study done on U.S. Spanish-Americans where serum retinol levelswere measured, 25% of the sample population had a serum retinol level below20ug/dlAs more studies are done on serum retinol levels in population groups ofthe U.S. that have had a history of high infection rates, we will probablysee a much stonger correlation between infection incidence rates and lowserum retinol levelsWhat do Weinsier and Morgan have to say about vitamin A?  Here are excerptfrom their bookVitamin A functions in vision in the forrm of retinol, it is necessay forgrowth and differentation of epithelial tissue, and is required forreproduction, embryonic development, and bone growth.  Protein-caloriemalnutrition and zinc deficiency may impair the absorption, transport, andmetabolism of vitamin A.  Retinaldehyde is converted to retinoic acid,which has biological activity in growth and in cell diferentiation but notin reproduction or vision.  The most common procedure to evaluate vitamin Astatus is to measure the retinol level in plasma or serum.  The normalrange for vitamin A content for a child is 20 to 90ug/dl.  Lower values areindicators of deficiency or depleted body stores.  Serum levels greaterthan 100ug/dl are indicative of toxic levels of vitamin A.  Dark adaptationtests and electroretinogram measurements are also useful but difficult toperform on young children.  Rapidly proliferating tissues are sensitive tovitamin A deficiency and may revert to an undifferentiated state.  Thebronchorespiratory tract, skin, genitourinary system, gastrointestinaltract and sweat glands are adversely affected.  A daily intake of more than7.5mg(about 37,000IU) of retinol is not advised and chronic use of amountsover 20mg(100,000IU) can result in a dry and itching skin, desquamation,erythematous dermatitis, hair loss, joint pain, chapped lips, hyperostoi(bony depositis), headaches, anorexia, edema and fatigue. They recommend 30mg of retinol via IM injection in children for vitamin Adeficiency but do not discuss treatment for adults.  Their toxic serum retinollevel is very conservative.  I recommend that my students try 25,000IU inadults that are having problems with chronic infection.  They have to ruleout a zinc deficit first by getting an RBC zinc run(or if their clinicallab can't run it, I tell them to do what Weinsier and Morgan suggest, givethem the zinc along with the vitamin A.  At 25,000IU per day, toxicityshould not be a problem and you will not have to worry about pulling thepatient into the office on a regular basis to run a serum retinolBoth Elaine and Jon found doctors who used a much higher dose of vitamin ARecall that the PMS papers were using 100,000IU to 200,000IU of vitamin AI don't suggest that my students use these high doses.  If you wanted tofill the liver up fast(as part of a clinical trial) and were monitoring theserum retinol level, then you would be okay.  But my knowledge of thevitamin A literature suggests to me that 25,000IU for patients with ademonstrated vitamin A deficit(dark adapatation test or serum retinol) willprovide a good and steady improvement(as long as zinc and vitamin C statusare good) without having to worry about toxicity.  If they want to get moreagressive, fine if they follow my advise to check the serum retinol.  Butvitamin A(retinol) should never be given in high dose to women who couldbecome pregnant since vitamin A shows teratogenicity towards the humanfetus.  The dose needed to show this effect on the developing fetus is18,000IU of retinol per day.  Beta-carotene will never have this effect onthe human fetusCould just taking Beta-carotene instead of retinol supplements help?  Yesbut the effect will take a long time to develop.  My advise is to useretinol to fill the liver up and then switch to beta-carotene to keep itfull.  Vitamin A is probably one nutrient that is better off left toprescription by doctors.  But when we have the M.D.'s in this newsgroupjumping all over me and other doctors that propose the use of vitamin Asupplements for treating patients with chronic sinus and GI distress, Ithink that the most prudent option is to keep vitamin A in the OTC marketbut require manufactors to provide package inserts to educate the generalpublic about the dangers of vitamin A supplementationMarty B

I am quite near sightedI've recently received laser treatment for both eyes to seaholes in the retinas to help prevent retinal detachment.

In my left eye I was seeing occasionaflashes of bright light prior to the treatment. Since thtreatment (two weeks) these flashes are now occuring more ofte- several each hourThe opthamologist explained the flashes are caused because thvitreous body has attached to the retina and is pulling on it.

Thetypes of cells that vitamin A regulates are the general epithelial cellsand these cell types are not the ones that function in the ear hearingprocess.  The hair cell nerve-like epithelial cells in the ear may respondto vitamin A during cellular differentiation(embryogenesis) but I don'tknow if they are still capable of responding in adults.  If they arecapable of responding with new hair growth, this would be a very majorbreakthrough in hearing loss.  With all of the medical interest in vitaminA, it would not be too surprising if a clinical study was done usingvitamin A to reverse hearing loss.  But with only a news announcement to goon(and this type of communication is notoriously bad), I can't comment onyour question anymore than I already have.  If one study has been done,more will need to follow to firm up a link between vitamin A and hearingloss if there really is oneMarty B.

It is important texercise (11, 12) and also avoid fat calories (9, 10)Chromium picolinate has shown to reduce fat and increaslean muscle (1, 2, 3).  I will not bore you with thstatistics.  You wouldn't believe these anywayChromium Picolinate is an exceptionally bioactive source othe essential mineral chromium.  Chromium plays a vital rolin "sensitizing" the body\'s tissues to the hormone insulinWeight gain in the form of fat tends to impair sensitivitto insulin and thus, in turn, makes it harder to losweight (4)Insulin directly stimulates protein synthesis and retardprotein breakdown in muscles (5, 6).  This "protein sparingeffect of insulin tends to decline during low calorie dietas insulin levels decline, which results in loss of muscland organ tissue.  By "sensitizing" muscle to insulinchromium picolinate helps to preserve muscle in dieterso that they "burn" more fat and less muscle.  Preservatioof lean body mass has an important long-term positiveffect on metabolic rate, helping dieters keep off thfat they've lostChromium picolinate promotes efficient metabolism by aidinthe thermogenic (heat producing) effects of insulinInsulin levels serve as a rough index of the availabilitof food calories, so it's not at all surprising that insulinstimulates metabolism (4, 7, 8).  Note that I did not sathat chromium picolinate increases metabolismIn summary, you need to change your life style in order tloose weight and stay healthy  A. Reduce dietary fat consumption to no more than 20% of calories     - Eating fat makes you fat  B. Increase dietary fibe     - low in calories; high in nutrients  C.

A single dose of acetaminophen of 10 grams or greatecan cause hepatotoxicity, and doses of 25 grams or more arpotentially fatal from hepatic necrosis.  If I recalcorrectly, the metabolism of acetaminophen at high doseinvolves N-hydroxylation to N-acetyl-benzoquinoneimine, whicis a highly reactive intermediate, which then reacts witsulfhydryl groups of proteins and glutathione.  When hepatiglutathione is used up, this intermediate then startattacking the hepatic proteins with resulting hepatinecrosis.  The insidious part of acetaminophen toxicity is thdelay (2-4 days) between ingestion and clinical signs of livedamage.  This is NOT a nice way to dieAs to taking 20-30 of these tablets, that comes to 5-7.5 gramof acetaminophen.

   Any opinions on Burzynski's antineoplastons or information about the current   status of his research would be appreciatedBurzynski's work is not too promising. None of his A-1 through A-antineoplastons have been shown to have antineoplastic effects againsexperimental cancer. The NCI conducted tests of A-2 and A-5 againsleukemia in mice, with the result that doses high enough to productoxic effects in the mice were not effective in inhibiting the growtof the tumor or killing it. (These were in 1983 and 1985Burzynski claims that A-10 is the active factor common to all of A-and A-5 (something which he has not shown, A-10 has only beeextracted from A-2. He also hasn't shown that A-1 through A-5 are actualldistinct substances). The NCI conducted a series of tests using A-1against a standard panel of tumors that included different cell linefrom tumors in the following classes: leukemia, non-small-cell ansmall-cell lung cancer, colon cancer, cancer of the central nervousystem, melanoma, ovarian cancer and renal cancer. A-10 exhibiteneither growth inhibition nor cytotoxicity at the dose levels testedIt is necessary to process A-10 since it is not soluble (Burzynski'theory requires soluble agents), but this basically hydrolizes it tPAG (which he calls AS 2.5). PAG is not an information carryinpeptide, something which Byrzynski claims is necessary foantineoplastic activity. AS 2.1 (also derived from A-10) is a 4:mixture of PA and PAG. PA (also not a peptide) can be purchased at chemical supply houses for about $0.09 a gram. A-10 is chemicallextremely similar to glutithamide and thalidomide, both of which arhabit forming and can cause peripheral neuropathy. The nasty effectof thalidomide are widely known. In spite of this similarity, A-1does not appear to have been tested for it's potential to inducteratogenicity or peripheral neuropathyMany of Burzynski's statements about the origin of his theory, earlresearch, past and present support by others for his work have beeshown to be untruesd--sdb@ssr.co

>I saw a printed up flyer that stated the person was >"licensed herbologist and iridologist>What are your opinions>How much can you tell about a person's health by looking into their eyesIts bogus.  See the sci.skeptic FAQ (I edit it)You can diagnose some things by looking at the eyes.  Glaucoma is thClassic Example, but there are probably othersIridology maps parts of the body onto the irises of the eyes.  Blooking at the patterns, striations and occasional blobs in the iriseyou are supposed to be able to diagnose illnesses all over the bodyThe two questions to ask any alternative therapist are1: How does it work2: What evidence is thereThe answer to question 1 takes a little knowledge of medicine tevaluate.  I don't know about iridology, but I've read a book oreflexology, which is a remarkably similar notion except that thorgans of the body are mapped onto the soles of the feet.  There arsupposed to be channels running down the body carrying information oenergy of some sort.  Anatomists have found no such structures(Always beware the words "channel" and "energy" in any spiel put ouby an alternative practitioner.The answer to question 2 is rather simpler.  If all they have ianecdotal evidence then forget it.  Ask for referreed papers imainstream medical journals.  Ignore any bull about the conspiracy orich doctors suppressing alternative practitioners.  Studies are donand papers are published.  Some of them are even positiveThe word "licensed" in the flyer is an interesting one.  Licensed bwhom?  For what?

I am asking for advicon how to repel wasps   This year the wasps have built their nest under a stone next to onof my tiny ponds. The caretaker (poor fellow!) will have to take carof them, and that will give me a head start on them. Last year wcouldn't find any nest. Even after the caretaker has gassed the nesin my tiny garden of 30 square meter, other wasps will most likely vifor the territory. Is there anything I can grow, rub on my skin ospread on the soil that will repel the black and yellow bastardsNever mind if it turns my skin purple or kills off all my beloveplants, I want to be able to spend time in my garden like everyonelse   Would it help to remove the ponds and the bird bath?

The diagnosis of CPH is made on the basis of liver biopsy. Iconsists of findings of portal inflammation, an intact periportal limitinplate, and on occasion isolated foci of intralobular necrosis. But in contrasto chronic active hepatitis (CAH) there is no periportal inflammation,bridging necrosis, or fibrosis.CPH has, indeed, an excellent prognosis. If I had to choose between CAH anCPH there is no question I would also choose CPH. However, as David pointeout, the distinction between the two is not as neat as some of us would havit.

Med. on thetopic of Colonic Flushing.  I'm in a profession that uses manipulation(avery refined form of massage) to treat various human diseases.  Provingthat manipulation works has been extremely difficult(as the MD's delight inpointing out).  The Osteopathic Profession seems to be making betterprogress than the chiropractors in proving(scientifically) that theirtechingues work.  The JAOA recently had a study on the use of manipulationto relieve mensrual cramps in women with results that were as good orbetter than drug treatment(using physiological measurements, and not justthe woman's preception of improvement).  This study was hailed by the JAOAeditors as the turning point in the profession's long struggle to proveitself to the medical communityI'm currently trying to get the AOA(American Osteopathic Association) whichhas supported most of the Osteopathic research in the U.S. to also supportnutrition education and research.  I've pointed out, in a grant proposal,that the founder of Osteopathic Medicine(A.T. Still) embraced both diet andmanipulation to set himself apart from the MD's of his time who were pushingonly drugs(Still was himself an MD who got real dissillusioned with drugsduring his service in the Civil War).  He decided that there had to be abetter way to treat human disease since he saw the cure(drugs) as beingworse than the disease.  Through his many years of study of the human body,he developed his manipulation techniques that he then taught to hisstudents in the U.S's first Osteopathic Medical school.  We now have 17Still used manipulation to treat(and also diagnose) human disease but heused diet to prevent human disease.  I'm trying to get the OsteopathicProfession to return to it's roots and beat the MD's to the punch(so tospeak).  Both DO's and MD's in current medical practice have very littleunderstanding of how diet affects human health.

I've read that exercise makes the heart pump more blood at a stroke, anthat it also makes the heart pumb slower, in order to make up for thgreater volume. My Internist, who diagnosed my AV block, slow heart ratand PVC's, told me something different. She says that heart rate iassociated with the electrical properties of the hear muscle, not itsize. Exercise lowers heart rate and increases stroke volume, but theffects are unrelated except for their common source. The AV block, shasserts, is another electrical effect, which is irreversable - even wheexercise is dicontinued. PVC's are also common in runners.So my EKG puts me in a class with trained athletes and also with hearpatients. Isn't that strange, though? Are there any not-so-beneficiaaspects to athlete's heart?

But most physicians feel that chronic infection in a child isnormal because of both exposure and lack of prior immunity to manyinfectious diseases.  I do not share this view and there are somephysicians who also suspect that diet plays a big role in infectionfrequency and severity.  Exposure to an infectious agent does not have toresult in a severe infection.  A strong immune response can minimize thelength of time needed to deal with the infection as well as the symptomsassociated with the infection> -- Is there any way to build immunity and resistanceThere are five major nutrients that are responsible for a good strongimmune response to infectious agents.  They are: protein, vitamin C,vitamin A, iron and zinc.  The American diet is not low in protein so thisis rarely a problem.  But vitamin A, vitamin C, iron and zinc are often lowand this lack of an adequate pool(nutrient reserve) can impair the immuneresponse.  Iron is know to be low in most kids(as is vitamin A).  There aredistinct biochemical tests that can be run to check the status of each ofthese nutrients in a patient who is having a problem with chronic severeinfection.  Serum ferritin for iron status, dark adaptation for vitamin Astatus, red blood cell zinc for zinc status and leckocyte ascorbate forvitamin C status.  I have attempted to work up posts on these fivenutrients and their role in infection for this news group as well as theothers that I participate in.  I can e-mail you what I've worked up so farBut my best advice to you is to try to find a physician who recognizes thecritical role that diet plays in the human immune response.  You may alsobe able to get help from a nutritionist.  Anyone can call themselves anutritionist so you have to be very carefull.  You want to find someonelike myself) who has had some formal training and education in nutritionMany Ph.D. programs in the U.S. now offer degrees in Nutrition and that'swhat you need to look for.

This means tugging on the top of the eato straighten out the ear canal, then inserting the thing snugly, thepushing a button.  Unfortunately, there are many things that can go wrongIt is almost impossible to aim the thing correctly when you do it onyourself.  I get readings which differ from each other by up to 2 degreesand may differ from an oral thermometer by up to 2 degrees. I talked to one of the nurses in my doctor's office recently about thisand she said she didn't like them either, for same reasons.  She did givme some instruction on how to tug on my ear, and what correct insertiofeels like, but she said she thought it was impossible to do correctlon one's self.  She also said that she and other nurses had complained tthe company about inaccurate readings, and that someone from the companhad told them to take great care to clean the infrared window at the enof the probe with alcohol from time to time.  She demonstrated this prioto reading my temperature, and managed to get a reading within 0.5 degreof the oral temperature I took at home before driving to the Dr's officeI have also noticed tha some nurses click the button, then remove thprobe immediately.  This causes wrong readings.  In my experience, yohave to leave the probe in a good 1 to 2 seconds after clicking the buttoto get a good measurement.  The nurse I talked with agreed.

I have osteoarthritis, and my huband has just been diagnosed with diabete(type II, I guess--no insulin).I've been trying to read up on these two conditions, and what reallsurprises me is how few experiments have been done and how little is known.Losing weight appears to be imperative for diabetes and advisable foarthritis (at least, for -women- with arthritis), but, of course, the verconditions that make weight loss advisable are part of the reason for thweight gain.For myself, I'm almost afraid to lose weight, because no matter how gentland sensible a diet I use (the last one was 1800-2000 calories, in aboueight small meals), the weight won't go off gradually and stay off.Instead, it drops off precipitously, and then comes back on with mucinterest, like bread on the watersWith this experience, it's hard to be encouraging to my husband.  All I casuggest is to make it as gradual as possibleMeanwhile, some experts recommend no sugar, others, no fat, others, just balanced diet.  It's almost impossible to tell from their writings -whichparts of their recommendations are supposed to help the condition, anwhich are merely ideas the expert thinks are niftyIs it my imagination, or are these very old conditions very poorlunderstood?  Is it just that I\'m used to pediatrician-talk ("It\'s strepgive him this and he\'ll get well.") and so my expectations are too high?Bonita Kal

I have been struck down this past week by a stomach bug and fevewhich went away quickly when treated with an antibiotic. Thpharmacist told me the antibiotic is effective against a widvariety of "gram-negative bacteria." I was wondering where might have acquired such a bacteria. Could they hang out in swimmingpool water, or would the chlorine kill them?Feeling better, I aJ. Bronsteidisraeli@leland.stanford.ed

Organization: Temple UniversitX-Newsreader: NNR/VM S_1.3.Last week I went to see a gastroenterologist. I had never met thidoctor before, and she did not know what I was there for. As soon as arrived, somebody showed me to an examining room and handed me a gownThey told me to undress (from the waist down, to be exact) and wait for thdoctor. Is this the usual drill when you go to a doctor for the firstime? I don't have much experience going to doctors (knock on wood), buon the couple of occasions when I've gone to a new doctor, I met hiwith my clothes on. First, he introduced himself, asked what I was therfor and took a history, all before I undressedAre patients usually expected to get naked before meeting a doctofor the first time? Personally, I'd prefer to meet the doctor osomething remotely resembling a condition of parity and to establish aidentity as a person who wears clothes before dropping my drawers. Inothing else, it minimizes the time that I have to spend in the selconscious, ill at ease and vulnerable condition of a person with a barbottom talking to somebody who is fully clothedDoes anybody besides me regard this get-naked-first-and-then-we-can-talattitude as insensitive? Also, is it unusualJames Arbuckle                          Email:  v5113e@vm.temple.ed

:Chronic persistent hepatitis is usually diagnosed when someone does a live:biopsy on a patient that has persistently elevated serum transaminases month:after a bout of acute viral hepatitis, or when someone is found to hav:persistently elevated transaminases on routine screening tests. The degree o:elevation (in the serum transaminases) can be trivial, or as much as ten time:normal. Other blood chemistries are usually normal.:As a rule, patients with CPH have no clinical signs of liver disease.:Chronic active hepatitis can also be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, a:least initially, and that's why it's important to tell them apart by means o:a biopsy. The patient with CPH only needs to be reassured. The patient wit:CAH needs to be treatedI just went back to the chapter in Cecil on chronic hepatitis.  It seemthat indeed most cases of CPH are persistant viral hepatitis, whereathere are a multitude of potential and probable causes for CAH (viraldrugs, alcohol, autoimmune, etc.).  Physicians seem to have a variety o"thresholds" for electing to biopsy someone\'s liver.  Personally, I thinthat if the patient is asymptomatic, with only slight transaminitis annormal albumin and PT, one can simply follow them closely and not add thpotential risks of a biopsy.  Others may well biopsy such a patient, thuproviding these samples for study.  It would be interesting to see ianyone's done any decision analysis on this--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-|-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  Kenneth Gilbert              __|__        University of Pittsburgh   =  General Internal Medicine      |      "...dammit, not a programmer!" =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-|-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
